DALL-E PROMPT FOR SLIDE 2
==================================================

A professional presentation slide design showing a modern, clean layout with the title "Two Ways to Communicate with AI" prominently displayed at the top center. The slide is divided into two main sections with distinct visual cues. The left section, titled "Browser," features a minimalist icon representing a web browser (e.g., a stylized "B" or a simple window icon) and a list of bullet points: "- More intuitive", "- Natural language", "- Context switching", "- Time-consuming", "- AI can only produce (multimodal) textual responses". The right section, titled "IDE (Integrated Development Environment)," features a minimalist icon representing a development environment (e.g., a stylized code editor icon or gears) and a list of bullet points: "- Learning curve", "- Some setup", "- Natural language + ...", "- AI embedded in the context", "- AI agents can autonomously read and edit files, search the web and write and run scripts". A subtle graphic or line should visually connect "Natural language" and "Natural language + ..." across the two sections to imply progression.

The overall color scheme is professional and tech-inspired, utilizing a dark background (deep navy or charcoal grey) with light, easily readable text (white or light grey). Key terms and titles are highlighted with a vibrant accent color (e.g., electric blue or emerald green). Icons are sleek, flat, and vector-style. Typography is modern, sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat, Open Sans), with a clear hierarchy for titles, subtitles, and body text. The layout is balanced, with ample negative space. A subtle, abstract geometric pattern or light streaks of code could be in the background, subtly hinting at AI and technology without distracting from the content. The aesthetic is bold, clear, and highly professional, suitable for a tech-focused academic presentation.
