      Livelihood</title>
      <para>
        1. This year marks the conclusion of the National 14th Five-Year
        Plan period and the preparatory year for the 15th Five-Year
        Plan. This Policy Address serves as a roadmap for Hong Kong to
        strive for a vibrant economy, pursue development, and improve
        people's livelihood – accelerating our advancement from
        stability to prosperity. It also outlines a strategic plan for
        Hong Kong to proactively align with national development
        strategies and achieve breakthroughs in forging a new landscape.
      </para>
      <para>
        2. My ultimate objective in governance is to improve people's
        livelihood with better housing for members of the public, higher
        income for workers, enhanced care for the elderly, and greater
        prospects for young people. The well-being of our people is
        intimately linked to the health of our economy, making economic
        growth the key driver of livelihood improvement. Growth creates
        job opportunities and wealth, which will in turn generate
        additional resources for public services, enabling the
        Government to deliver more and better services. Improvement in
        people's livelihood will then spark new social demands that
        stimulate market development, further promoting economic growth.
        The economy and people's livelihood are mutually reinforcing:
        each strengthens the other.
      </para>
      <para>
        3. Since taking office, I have been actively promoting reforms,
        both within the Government and in the wider community, thereby
        facilitating economic growth and improving people's livelihood.
        I have transformed and instilled in the Government a culture
        that is &quot;result-oriented&quot;. We have been pressing ahead
        with public housing production and introduced Light Public
        Housing (LPH). Three years ago, applicants for public rental
        housing (PRH) waited an average of 6.1 years for a flat; the
        Composite Waiting Time is now 5.1 years, a reduction of one full
        year. Over the same period, the median household income rose by
        $3,000, an increase of 11%. Since I assumed office, the economy
        has rebounded – turning from negative to positive and gaining
        momentum. This year's growth is projected at 2% – 3%. In the
        past three years, Hong Kong has moved up one place to become the
        third-ranked global financial centre and has climbed four spots
        to rank third globally in overall competitiveness. In the last
        two years, we have risen 12 places to the fourth globally in
        talent competitiveness. Furthermore, Hong Kong is ranked seventh
        among the world's top 10 safest cities.
      </para>
      <para>
        4. The Policy Address this year is anchored in two pillars: the
        economy and people's livelihood.
      </para>
      <para>
        5. The Northern Metropolis is the new engine for Hong Kong's
        economic development and holds immense potential. I will
        accelerate its development and set up the Committee on
        Development of the Northern Metropolis under my guidance to
        formulate operational models for the various development areas
        therein. I will also expedite the development of the University
        Town, streamline administrative procedures by removing barriers
        and easing restrictions, adopt safe, efficient and
        cost-effective construction practices, and introduce dedicated
        legislation to fast-track the Northern Metropolis development.
        The Government will attract and cultivate industries to create
        jobs and enhance productivity. Preferential policy packages will
        also be formulated to improve efficiency and flexibility in
        negotiations with enterprises that are establishing and scaling
        up operations, thereby creating more high-quality, high income
        jobs and further boosting productivity.
      </para>
      <para>
        6. Under &quot;One Country, Two Systems&quot;, Hong Kong enjoys
        the unique advantages of attracting overseas enterprises and
        assisting Mainland enterprises to go global. In the past, we
        focused primarily on bringing in enterprises, achieving
        remarkable growth and success. The new opportunities ahead for
        Hong Kong, however, will come from helping Mainland enterprises
        expand abroad. This rapid shift in opportunities reflects the
        reshaping of the global trade order, prompting Mainland
        enterprises to shift from concentrating on a single market and
        towards proactively tapping into emerging markets. The
        Government will leverage Hong Kong's strength as a platform for
        going global to reinforce the role of Hong Kong as an
        international centre, capitalising on our advantages in areas
        such as finance, trading, professional services, supply chain
        management and professional networks, creating more jobs and
        higher income, further promoting the headquarters economy to
        unlock more business opportunities. We will also develop
        education, technology and talent in an integrated manner, and
        press ahead with the integrated development of culture, sports
        and tourism, enabling the people of Hong Kong to live in a
        community with thriving economy and vibrant culture.
      </para>
      <para>
        7. To strengthen governance, I will establish an accountability
        system for Heads of Department (HoDs) by systematising and
        institutionalising their responsibility for their departments,
        and enhance the appraisal system for civil servants so that a
        culture of continuous improvement can take root. I will also set
        up the AI Efficacy Enhancement Team to drive technological
        reform, co-ordinating and steering government departments in the
        effective use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and in
        the re-engineering of outdated workflows. Meanwhile, I will
        promote the development of AI+ with strong emphasis on safety
        risk prevention, and implement AI government services and
        facilitate the wide-scale application and development of AI
        across different sectors in the society to boost overall
        efficiency. I will also put into practice the philosophy of
        better integration of &quot;an efficient market&quot; with
        &quot;a capable government&quot;, and introduce market-based
        business model to enhance the services of the Leisure and
        Cultural Services Department (LCSD).
      </para>
      <para>
        8. This Policy Address concludes with the most extensive chapter
        concerning people's livelihood. It encompasses nine critical
        areas which are essential to the well-being of the community,
        covering land and housing, transport, healthcare, social
        welfare, labour protection and a caring and inclusive society,
        under which include continuously increasing public housing
        supply to enrich the housing ladder; creating land for large
        development projects, promoting long-term economic development
        and addressing housing needs while increasing government land
        reserve; continuing healthcare reform; implementing 11 measures
        to support local economy, continuing the work on targeted
        poverty alleviation, promoting the principle of &quot;ageing in
        place as the core, with institutional care as back-up&quot;,
        supporting and protecting workers, and establishing the Working
        Group on Ageing Society Strategies to meet the challenges
        brought by ageing. These demonstrates my commitment to placing
        people's livelihood at the heart of governance. Indeed, economic
        development ultimately serves the well-being of our people,
        enabling them to enjoy better quality of life.
      </para>
      <para>
        9. I would like to thank the public for their valuable opinions
        during the consultation exercise, and for their broad support of
        my policy directions and strategies. This Policy Address will
        elaborate on our policy objectives, key measures and key
        performance indicators (KPIs). A Supplement offering more
        details on the policy measures and related matters has also been
        compiled.

          <para>
            10. As President Xi Jinping pointed out, &quot;One Country,
            Two Systems&quot; possesses its distinctive institutional
            strengths and strong vitality, is a good system that
            sustains the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong
            and Macao. It is a good system that facilitates endeavours
            to build China into a great country and achieve national
            rejuvenation, and it is a good system for ensuring peaceful
            coexistence and mutual benefit between different social
            systems. So we must stay committed to this cause.
          </para>
          <para>
            11. We will continue to fully, faithfully and resolutely
            implement &quot;One Country, Two Systems&quot;, &quot;Hong
            Kong people administering Hong Kong&quot; and a high degree
            of autonomy. &quot;One Country, Two Systems&quot; is the
            best institutional arrangement for maintaining Hong Kong's
            long-term prosperity and stability. The more firmly the
            &quot;One Country&quot; principle is upheld, the greater the
            strength the &quot;Two Systems&quot; will be unleashed.
          </para>
          <para>
            12. Being a global metropolis, Hong Kong has remained an
            open, inclusive, safe and stable city underpinned by the
            rule of law since our return to the Motherland 28 years ago.
            With an ever-expanding influence internationally, Hong Kong
            is rated the world's freest economy, as well as an advanced
            and business-friendly city. These fully demonstrate the
            notable institutional strengths and great vitality of
            &quot;One Country, Two Systems&quot;.
          </para>
          <para>
            13. Hong Kong has solid backing from the Motherland,
            enjoying far-reaching opportunities brought by national
            development, from the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay
            Area (GBA) to the Belt and Road (B&amp;R) Initiative.
            Meanwhile, as an international city with its distinctive
            role of connecting to the rest of the world, Hong Kong also
            has infinite room for development.
          </para>
          <para>
            14. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
            Government will, as always, maintain the constitutional
            order of the HKSAR as stipulated under the Constitution and
            the Basic Law, ensuring the steadfast and successful
            implementation of &quot;One Country, Two Systems&quot;.

            15. The fundamental premise of &quot;One Country, Two
            Systems&quot; is to safeguard sovereignty, security and
            development interests of our nation.
          </para>
          <para>
            16. Since the implementation of the Hong Kong National
            Security Law five years ago, we have overcome turmoil and
            unrest, and maintained safety and stability in our society.
            Hong Kong has transitioned from chaos to order and is now
            advancing from stability to prosperity. The HKSAR Government
            will continue to steadfastly safeguard national sovereignty,
            security and development interests, while thoroughly
            adopting the Holistic Approach to National Security. We will
            remain vigilant at all times, prevent and mitigate risks,
            and ensure the long-term stability and safety of Hong Kong.
          </para>
          <para>
            17. We will continue to enhance the legal system and
            enforcement mechanism for safeguarding national security,
            doing our utmost to ensure that laws are observed and
            strictly enforced to bring offenders to account, so as to
            prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and
            activities endangering national security.
          </para>
          <para>
            18. The Government will spare no effort in promoting
            national security education. Since its opening a year ago,
            the National Security Exhibition Gallery has already
            attracted over one million visitors. More than 3 300
            national security education district tutors have been
            trained to promote national security messages in the
            community.

            19. With the improved electoral system and district
            governance system of the HKSAR, the principle of
            &quot;patriots administering Hong Kong&quot; has been fully
            implemented. The HKSAR Government has held six important
            elections, including the recent Election Committee Subsector
            By-elections.

            the Government set up the Steering Committee on District
            Governance and the Task Force on District Governance in July
            2023. They are chaired by the Chief Secretary for
            Administration and the Deputy Chief Secretary for
            Administration respectively, with the aim of strengthening
            co-ordination to address issues such as environmental

            23. This year marks the 80th anniversary of victory in the
            Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese
            Aggression and in the World Anti-Fascist War. The HKSAR
            Government has organised a series of large-scale
            commemorative activities, including exhibitions, film
            screenings and library events, for the public to gain a
            deeper understanding of the spirit of unity and resilience
            displayed by Chinese people in the fight for peace. We will
            collaborate with Shenzhen to promote a new red educational
            route, under the theme of &quot;Chinese Cultural Celebrity
            Rescue&quot; history, so as to enhance understanding among

            forward reforms to build a &quot;result-oriented&quot;
            government. In the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025, Hong
            Kong ranked second globally in &quot;Government
            efficiency&quot;, reflecting well on Hong Kong's civil
            servants being an outstanding team, and the reforms
            introduced by the current-term Government, alongside the
            concerted efforts of the civil service.

            inevitably occur in individual departments. The causes
            behind them must be identified in good time and rectified to
            prevent them from undermining the overall trust that society
            places in the Government, and to avoid causing injustice to
            the overwhelming majority of our civil servants, who are
            dedicated to their duties.

            31. I believe that effective management is of utmost
            importance. Senior civil servants are all responsible for
            management. I have therefore been considering ways to
            strengthen their sense of responsibility to enhance the
            overall management standard of the departments. After
            considerations, I believe that the most direct and effective
            way is to strengthen the accountability of the HoDs by
            clearly emphasising that HoDs are tasked to build a strong
            management team, and lead their senior civil servants to
            jointly manage staff and operation systems. While HoDs have
            always been responsible for the work of their departments,
            the Government has not yet institutionalised overall
            accountability. Establishing a Heads of Department
            Accountability System (the HoD Accountability System),
            therefore, is of critical significance. The details are as
            follows.

            capital, data and talent, together with abundant use cases,
            Hong Kong is poised to become a global hub for AI
            development. The Government will step up the promotion of AI
            as a core industry for Hong Kong's development, guided by
            the strategy of &quot;strengthening infrastructure and
            promoting the application-oriented approach&quot;. We will

            152. During my visit to Hangzhou's &quot;Six Little
            Dragons&quot; in Zhejiang, I was aware of a new technology
            that enables a breakthrough benefitting people with
            amputations. Prostheses incorporating new R&amp;D
            technologies are embedded with sensors that can detect
            neural signals transmitted from muscles to control
            prosthetic movements without having to implant any device or
            wiring. With some training, wearers of these prostheses are
            able to perform daily activities such as writing or playing
            musical instruments. The Government will support
            people-oriented scientific research through the Innovation
            and Technology Fund to introduce prostheses built with new
            R&amp;D technologies. A two-year scheme will be introduced
            to grant full subsidies to amputees in Hong Kong for the
            configuration and use of the high-tech prostheses free of
            charge, enabling them to benefit from new technologies.

              170. Since the implementation of an array of new talent
              admission policies by the current-term Government, over
              230 000 people have come to Hong Kong for work and
              development. Among the various schemes, the Top Talent
              Pass Scheme (TTPS) has recorded an application rate as
              high as 55% for extension of stay. TTPS talents granted an
              extension of stay are of high-calibre. They are mainly
              employed in the I&amp;T and financial sectors in Hong
              Kong. Of them, 95% receive a monthly income higher than
              the local median income of about $20,000, and 50% earn a
              monthly income nearly double that amount. This reflects a
              strong demand for TTPS talents and the market's
              willingness to offer higher salaries to attract them. The
              TTPS contributes about $34 billion a year to the local
              economy, equivalent to approximately 1.2% of our GDP.

              fourth place globally this year, ranking first in the Asia
              Pacific region. This reflects that our talent policy is on
              the right track and effective, and is one of the important
              driving forces for economic development. The Government
              will continue to implement talent policies to ensure our
              long-term competitiveness to drive sustained economic
              growth.

        These efforts aim to enhance our economy's long-term
        competitiveness, generate strong growth momentum, and lay a

        people – ultimately increasing their sense of happiness and

          207. Safeguarding the basic housing needs of people of Hong
          Kong is the top priority of our governance. Since assuming
          office, I have strengthened housing protection for the
          grassroots by accelerating the construction of PRH, launching
          the innovative LPH and cracking down on PRH tenancy abuse.
          With the supply of PRH continuously increasing, the Government
          is now well positioned to further assist the grassroots in
          achieving home ownership. We will increase the supply of flats
          under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) and the Green Form
          Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme (GSH), optimise the sale and
          alienation restriction arrangements, help more PRH tenants
          realise home ownership, while enabling the owners of
          subsidised sale flats (SSFs) enter into the private housing
          market. With the housing ladder enriched, we can support
          residents across all walks of life to live and work happily.

            189 000 units, about 80% higher than when I took office.
            Three years ago, PRH applicants had to wait 6.1 years on
            average before they were offered PRH. With our efforts over
            the past three years or so, the Composite Waiting Time for
            Subsidised Rental Housing has been shortened by a whole year
            to 5.1 years, and we are moving closer to the target of

                significantly. On the basis that the supply of HOS flats
                are substantially increasing, we will increase the ratio
                of quotas between GF and WF from 40:60 to 50:50 to

            treatment, the Government places great importance on the
            public's mental health and has introduced a Three-tier
            School-based Emergency Mechanism. We also place equal
            emphasis to prevention, which involves building families,
            friendships and interpersonal networks; focusing on the
            development of interests and personality; and creating
            supportive environments in schools and workplaces. All these
            initiatives require joint efforts, bringing together the
            Government, the community and families, as well as
            professional support and treatment when needed. The

            scale helps ease manpower shortages and serves Hong Kong's
            overall interests. We will launch measures to ensure the
            employment priority of local workers and combat the abuse of
            the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS). Starting
            tomorrow, when applying to import waiters/waitresses and

            all backgrounds and educational attainments, to enhance
            their skills and competitiveness on a continuous basis, to
            meet the needs of economic and industrial development in

            services as training and career planning, and outlined an
            initial reform roadmap for the next three years. The ERB
            will strengthen its industry consultative mechanism, and
            identify demand for and gaps in core skills in a targeted
            manner to devise a skills-based training framework. It will
            collaborate with higher education institutions and guide
            other training bodies in developing courses of various types
            and levels to fill the skill gaps. In future, the ERB will
            also launch micro-credential courses recognised by
            industries to offer greater flexibility to trainees, and
            make good use of technology to offer diversified and
            flexible modes of learning. When the ERB finalises the full
            implementation by the end of this year, the Government will
            amend the Employees Retraining Ordinance accordingly.

            persons and persons with disabilities (PWDs). When carers
            are provided with appropriate support to alleviate physical
            and mental stress, they are better able to take care of
            elderly persons and PWDs. Current measures include providing

            respite services to give carers a break, setting up a

              life. The Government will, starting from the second
              quarter of 2026, progressively introduce one-stop support
              and care services at hostels for severely and moderately
              mentally handicapped persons, and increase the number of
              extended care places at hostels co-located with
              DACs/integrated vocational rehabilitation services
              centres. These measures will release about 700 day
              rehabilitation training places, providing day training for
              PWDs living in the community and alleviating the pressure
              on carers.

            formulate the &quot;Silver Q-Mark&quot;, and with the trade
            to consider setting additional GBA Standards for silver

            266. Ageing is a global issue. By 2046, people aged 65 and
            above will account for 36% of our total population. To
            tackle challenges of an ageing society, the Government will
            set up a Working Group on Ageing Society Strategies under
            the steer of the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration
            to co-ordinate the efforts of various bureaux in formulating
            the relevant strategy responses. Aside from covering areas
            such as elderly care, healthcare, housing, culture and
            leisure, and gerontechnology, the working group will
            consider promoting the further development of silver

            shifted from the non-interventionist approach adopted by the
            Government of the previous terms to the multi-pronged policy
            approach launched in 2023 to promote fertility. We have

            tax deduction ceiling for home loan interest or domestic
            rents, introducing a new tax deduction for the medical
            expenses of assisted reproductive services, and increasing
            the basic child allowance and additional child allowance in
            the year of birth. We have also implemented various support

              a Youth Network and a Women's Network at the 10 Support
              Service Centres for EMs to organise activities
              specifically for EM youth and women. Moreover, the

            have set up three additional Care Teams and revised the KPIs
            for the second term of service. To enable Care Teams to
            continuously enhance their services, the Government has
            increased the subsidy by 50%, in accordance with last year's
            Policy Address, and provided these voluntary Care Teams with
            additional administrative support, including hiring
            administrative staff. As for emergency support, we will
            enhance training so that Care Teams can continue to

        282. Today, Hong Kong is at the critical juncture of advancing
        from stability to prosperity. We are moving through an
        irreversible economic transition, but it is an essential process
        for a stronger and more robust economy in the future.
      </para>
      <para>
        283. Over the decades, Hong Kong has undergone multiple economic
        transitions. Once, the bustling Sheung Wan night market (the
        &quot;Dai-tat-dei&quot;) sold paraffin lamps that were a big
        business until modern malls made them unnecessary. Bustling
        factories that once competed for female labour have since
        relocated their production lines to the Mainland, opening new
        horizons for the manufacturers. Pagers, once a common sight in
        every hand, have been replaced by smartphones, leaving behind
        empty pager shops as relics of a past era. Each change brought
        about a stronger economy and higher income for the people.
      </para>
      <para>
        284. These transformations were possible because generations of
        Hong Kong people have worked hard, stayed flexible, and never
        given up. That grit is part of our DNA, and it will continue to
        be the engine that drives us forward.
      </para>
      <para>
        285. We must not be complacent, nor should we underestimate our
        own capabilities. In the last three years, Hong Kong has climbed
        higher thanks to the teamwork of the Government and the
        community. We have risen one spot to become the world's
        third-largest international financial centre, and our overall
        competitiveness has jumped four places to also rank third
        globally. In talent competitiveness, we have leapt twelve spots,
        now sitting at fourth in the world. The number of registered
        local companies has hit a record high, as has the number of
        non-local companies setting up operations in Hong Kong. The
        median household income has also grown by 11%, an increase of
        $3,000. These numbers tell a clear story: investors around the
        world trust Hong Kong, and our city is vibrant, stable, and
        poised for long-term growth under &quot;One Country, Two
        Systems&quot;.
      </para>
      <para>
        286. Hong Kong faces challenges and is also presented with
        continuing opportunities amid the changing world. Our country,
        the world's second-largest economy, is our staunchest supporter
        and the source of our biggest opportunities. Combined with Hong
        Kong's international prospects, our opportunities far outweigh
        the challenges. By working together, innovating, and embracing
        reform, we will turn our beloved Hong Kong into an even better
        home for everyone. The Pearl of the Orient will keep shining
        brighter than ever before.
