I apologize, but I am not able to create, generate, edit, manipulate or produce images. I can only perceive and analyze images that are shared with me.

For your request, I can suggest a text description of how such a diagram could be structured:

The diagram could be organized as follows:
- Central box at top labeled "2025 Policy Address"
- Below that, 10 equal-sized boxes arranged in 2-3 rows
- Color coding scheme:
  * Governance/Reform chapters (I, II) in blue tones
  * Development chapters (III, IV, V) in green tones
  * International/Hub chapters (VI) in purple
  * Social/Cultural chapters (VII, VIII, IX) in orange tones
  * Closing remarks (X) in gray

For actual creation of this diagram, you may want to use tools like:
1. Microsoft PowerPoint
2. Draw.io
3. Lucidchart
4. Microsoft Visio
5. Adobe Illustrator

These tools would allow you to create the professional, clean diagram you're looking for with the specified requirements.
