ABOUT THE BASR

The British Association for the Study of Religions (BASR)
was founded in 1954. It is a member association of the In-

ternational Association for the History of Religions (foun-

ded 1950) and of the European Association for the Study
of Religions (founded 2001). The object of BASR is to pro-

mote the academic study of religion/s, understood as the

historical, social, theoretical, critical and comparative
study of religion/s through the interdisciplinary collabora-

tion of all scholars whose research is defined in this way.
BASR is not a forum for confessional, apologetic, or similar
concerns. BASR pursues its aims principally through an an-

nual conference and general meeting, a regular Bulletin,
and a Journal of the British Association for the Study of
Religions. Membership of BASR is open to all scholars nor-

mally resident in the United Kingdom.

All correspondence concerning the BASR should be sent

editorial

Welcome to the May 2024 edition of the BASR Bullet-
in. I am grateful to Theo Wildcroft for giving me the
opportunity to write this issue’s editorial to discuss
the upcoming BASR annual conference at the Uni-
versity of Leeds on September 2-4, 2024.

This year’s theme is an increasingly important one in
the scholarly study of religion: ‘Reckoning with the
Past.’ There will allow our conference to cover themes
such as the decolonisation of the study of religion,
anti-racist education and education about the slave
trade; in addition to the history of religious studies
and colonial impacts. Simultaneously, religious insti-
tutions are also reckoning with their own problematic
histories, which we’re sure to explore in this confer-
ence. The study of religion has always thrived as an in-
terdisciplinary endeavour and this conference is no
different – if your research touches upon these
themes, we encourage you to submit a proposal and
get involved with the proceedings. Before departing
the conference, be sure to take the opportunity to ex-
plore the many wonderful things to see at the city of
Leeds – I’ve been based here for the past two years
and can attest to its brilliance.

Once again, we are working with CenSAMM, allowing
us to broaden the scope of the conference to issues
pertaining to apocalypticism, millenarianism, and en-
vironmental concerns. We are also receiving support
from the Hibbert Trust and are grateful to both for
their enthusiasm and support. Collaborations such as
these are essential as we continue in precarious
times for Higher Education.

On that note, it is important to note the elephant in
the room. As Stephen Gregg mentioned at last year’s
AGM, we are increasingly keen to receive offers to
host our annual conference from BASR members –
thus far, the vast majority of BASR conferences have
been organised/hosted by committee members and
their respective institutions. This is difficult to sus-

tain. Yet conferences are part of the lifeblood of the
BASR – it is not only important to the discipline and
our research community, but also its nurturing of fu-
ture generations of scholars. Attending BASR confer-
ences has been instrumental in my own career, and I
know that I’m not alone in that regard. Beyond that,
hosting the BASR is a great opportunity in itself – so
please do speak to a BASR committee member if this
interests you!

Teaching and learning can often be sidelined in aca-
demia in favour of conversations surrounding re-
search, but these are also utterly essential to the
future of our discipline. The study of religion works
best when making a public impact, and our students
are often our largest public. This year’s conference will
include a Lightning Talks panel for Masters stu-
dents/early postgraduate researchers to present
brief talks on their on-going or recently completed
projects.

The contents of the bulletin speak to the vibrant
community we have within the BASR and the work we
do – including conference reports, teaching and
learning activities, Meet the Members reports, and,
sadly, reflections on departed colleagues. The recent
announcement of closures at the University of Kent is
a sobering reminder of the ongoing challenges we
face; yet, as current affairs demonstrate, our discip-
lines are needed more than ever. I suspect these con-
versations will be prominent when we gather in
September to seek collective ways forward. Please
do share the CFP far and wide (along with the
#BASR2024 hashtag) so that we can ensure as broad
and lively conversations as possible.

I look forward to welcoming you, with my co-organiser
Mel Prideaux, to Leeds in September!

2024 BASR TEACHING AND LEARNING FELLOWSHIP

Each year, the BASR Exec awards a single Teaching and Learning Fellowship to a colleague in recognition of their contribution to the student learning experience in the study of religions. This Fellowship includes an award of £300 plus a funded place at the BASR Annual Conference. The expectation of the person receiving this Fellowship is to write a short piece reflecting on current issues/ experiences of teaching Religious Stud- ies in HE for the BASR Bulletin and help the Teaching and Learning Rep on the BASR Exec, Steffi Sinclair, or- ganise the teaching and learning panel for the 2025 BASR conference. However, there is a lot of flexibility in how this could be approached.

If you would like to be considered for the 2024 BASR Teaching and Learning Fellowship or would like to nomin- ate a colleague (or have any questions about this Fellowship), please get in touch with Steffi at stefanie.sin- clair@open.ac.uk. Your application will need to be supported by a brief statement that outlines the contribution the applicant/ nominee has made to the student learning experience in the study of religions in HE with reference to any of the following four themes:

•
Influencing and inspiring students’ learning;
•
Influencing and inspiring colleagues’ teaching;
•
Innovation and development of practice;
•
Personal reflection on practice.

This statement can be provided either by the applicant themselves or by a colleague supporting the applica- tion. The deadline for nominations/ applications is the 21st June 2024. We welcome applications from/ nom- inations for colleagues at all stages of their careers.

TEACHING AND LEARNING PANEL (BASR CONFERENCE 2024)

Teaching and Learning in Religious Studies Higher Education: Reassessing Teaching about Religion and the Natural World

After last year’s hugely successful BASR conference on “Environmental endings and religious futures”, and in the context of increasingly urgent warnings about the potential effects of anthropogenic global warming, this seems an important time to evaluate and reassess how teaching and learning in religious studies engages with the natural world.

Leading on from last year’s discussions, we are inviting proposals for a panel that aims to stimulate discus- sion around critical, ethical and pedagogical aspects of teaching about religion and the environment in the current age of climate crisis. We especially invite papers that provide critical and/or experience-based re- flections on the teaching of religion(s), nature and the climate crisis with a view to furthering the conversa- tion around these and related issues.

news, etc


## Page 5

Papers might touch on a wide range of themes, for example: whether the climate emergency opens up new opportunities for teaching to engage with students’ own subjective responses to nature; what ethical implic- ations arise when teaching about religious responses to science-based predictions of potential impending catastrophe; how the developing climate crisis impacts on wider teaching about religion(s) and worldviews; and how we can develop a curriculum that tackles religion and climate change from a genuinely interdisciplin- ary perspective.

Please send your proposal along with your title and institutional affiliation to the panel convenors: Dr Stefanie Sinclair (stefanie.sinclair@open.ac.uk) and Dr Claire Wanless (claire.wanless@ed.ac.uk) by 31st May 2024.

PRACTICE IN DEVELOPMENT: SPECIAL ISSUE

LGBTQ+, diverse sexual orientation and gender identities, and faith in development

This special issue seeks to address the multiple and overlapping issues that emerge between people with di- verse sexual orientation and gender identities and faith actors in the context of international development. We invite papers that critically engage with the current academic debates and practice/policy approaches, addressing the experiences of people with diverse sexual orientation and gender identities and faith actors in international development to find constructive paths forward. We approach ‘international development’ in the broadest sense of the term and view it as processes aimed at bringing about positive social change, be it in the Global South or North. This includes work that may not be perceived as ‘development’ by those working on it. We are particularly interested in papers from people who are part of diverse sexual orientation and gender identities communities and/or faith communities as well as people from the Global South, racial, eth- nic and religious minorities, and other marginalised groups. The special issue will include both full academic articles and shorter practice notes reflecting on learnings from practical work.

For further information, contact Jennifer Philippa Eggert (jennifer@jliflc.com).

LAUNCH OF THE RELIGION RESEARCH GROUP AT BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON

BASR members Dr Eleanor T. Higgs and Dr. Owen Coggins, with their colleague Dr. Sam Han announce the launch of the Religion Research Group at Brunel University London. Brunel does not have a Religious Studies department, so the new Religion Research Group exists to connect colleagues at the university working on diverse dimensions of religion in different disciplines, including psychology, sociology, anthropology, law, his- tory, education, social work, and media studies. For us, ‘religion’ includes traditions, beliefs, groups, and prac- tices, in plural sociocultural, political, and legal contexts, and in interaction with arts, media, and political movements. Through transdisciplinary research and scholarship, RRG members are engaged with theoretical innovations and in conversation with grassroots organisation and communities. We generate new knowledge about religion, belief, and practice - and we bring critical perspectives to existing knowledge.

From our different disciplinary locations, Religion Research Group members conduct critical, socially en- gaged, and participatory research with groups and communities in different parts of the world. We are long- standing and active participants in relevant scholarly associations including the British Association for the Study of Religions (BASR), British Sociological Association Sociology of Religion group (BSA SocRel), Centre for the Critical Study of Apocalyptic and Millenarian Movements (CenSAMM), International Society for Metal Music Studies, and the International Association for the Study of Religion and Gender (IARG). Research pro- jects of RRG members have been funded by the American Historical Association, the American Institute of Indian Studies, the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), the British Academy, the Druze Heritage Foundation, the Issachar Fund, the John Templeton Foundation, and the Leverhulme Trust. Current and planned activities include a working paper seminar series, a guest lecture series, and collaborative research projects.

'35 YEARS OF INFORM' SEMINAR
KING'S COLLEGE, LONDON, JANUARY 2024

The most recent Inform conference was held at
King’s College’s Bush House on the thirteenth of
January, with the various featured speakers all
actively acknowledging and celebrating the mile-
stone of the charity’s 35th year of operation.
The importance of Inform within the field of New
Religious Movement (NRM) studies cannot be
understated – an importance which cannot be
appreciated without acknowledging its founder
Professor Eileen Barker. As a seminal figure in
NRM studies, Barker’s hugely influential ‘Making
of a Moonie: Choice or Brain-
washing?’ (1984) provided a
sympathetic
perspective,
with
the
rejection
of
the
‘brainwashing’ thesis in favour
of the demystification of NRM
conversion
processes.
Em-
blematic of Barker’s work, In-
form has sought to prevent
the harm that can be caused
through misinformation about
minority religions, by bringing
the insights of academic re-
search into the public domain.

The event saw a prompt start with Amanda van
Eck Duymaer van Twist, Georgie Chryssides and
Marat Shterin all providing short introductions –
each speaker elaborated on the evolving face of
the study of New Religious Movements, and how
adequately equipped Inform is to facilitate col-
laborative conversation between communities
for years to come. The last of these commencing
addresses came from Professor Barker, who de-
livered a heartfelt speech conveying the import-
ance of those who have dedicated their time to
sustaining Inform’s existence. Equal parts mod-
est and moving, her words united those in at-
tendance who stand as representatives for
several communities who, like Barker, are primar-

ily interested in the study of “peculiar people.”
Linda Woodhead then provided the event’s key-
note address, speaking at length about Inform’s
firm power as an “antidote” to unproductive and
stereotyped conversation between members of
conflicting communities.

The first panel platformed the stories of several
members and ex-members of a range of NRMs.
As honorary director Suzanne Newcombe identi-
fied, Inform is far from the official expert in the
context of people’s lived experiences, and so it
is the essence of this panel that exemplifies In-

form's emphasis on the trian-
gulation
of
data
through
several
sources
and
net-
works. The panel opened with
secretary of the Pagan Feder-
ation, Vivianne Crowley, who
detailed the way in which In-
form provided necessary de-
mystification
amidst
the
satanic panic scare of the
early 1990s, and in assisting
in the federation’s longstand-
ing battle to be recognised as
an official registered charity.
Hazel Barlow, a former mem-
ber of the Unification movement, then provided
a short speech on the ways in which Inform was
a source of valuable clarificatory information in
both her personal and academic life, praising
Professor Barker’s foresight in creating such an
important
educational
organisation.
Next
to
speak was full-time staff member of the Church
of Scientology, Graeme Wilson. Wilson honoured
Inform in its role of “filling a vital need” in the
context of clarifying academic truths against
sensationalised media stories, offering “a much-
needed sane alternative.” Wilson praised the
charity’s power to “resolve situations of dishar-
mony and conflicts and repair upsets” caused by
misinformation. The panel closed with William
Haines, a current member of the Unification

conferences

movement. After Haines joined the movement,
his mother was understandably concerned as a
result of widespread
media
misinformation.
Haines personal reflection commended Inform
for their work in supporting concerned relatives
through the provision of unbiased and factually
correct information about the Unification move-
ment.

The second panel platformed various academ-
ics who have engaged with Inform over its
thirty-five years of operation. First to speak was
Professor Milda Alisauskiene. Marking her initial
interactions with Inform as a “turning point” in
her academic career, Alisauskiene detailed how
Professor Barker’s agreement to supervise her
master’s thesis cemented Barker as a role mod-
el in her life. Within an event which had so far
highlighted Inform’s importance in a British con-
text, this speech branched explored Inform’s
global
relevance.
Alisauskiene
remarked
on
Barker’s
constant
academic
communication
with the Lithuanian Centre for New Religions
Research and Information, to demonstrate how
inspirational Barker’s forethought has been in
the creation of like-groups worldwide. The next
speaker was Susannah Crockford, who originally
came to Inform to consult its database, yet
eventually became an Inform staff member
after being inspired by the interactions with
members of the public via the phone lines. It
was these conversations that, for Crockford,
emphasised how imperative Inform’s work is in
manufacturing
spaces
which
don’t
ridicule
members of NRMs, and take people and their
testimonies seriously. Next to speak was Pro-
fessor Abby Day, who reflected on her upbring-
ing in the heart of North American cultic
discourse of figures such as Jim Jones and
Charles Manson. Highlighting the demystifying
power of Inform’s services, Day reflected on
how these people were deemed “strange” be-
cause they were “made strange by those in es-
tablished
religions
who
wanted
to
view
themselves as more authentic or established.”
The ‘academics’ panel closed with Professor
Jean La Fontaine, who gratefully reflected on In-
form’s capacity in making her academic re-
search into ‘satanic panic’ a reality, effectively
turning something which “sounded like a dan-
gerous or ridiculous” idea into an approachable
task.

The penultimate panel of the day saw several
professional speakers detail the ways in which
they, or the communities they have attended on
behalf of, have benefitted directly from the ser-
vices provided by Inform. First to speak was Re-
vd
Pedr
Beckley,
who
accentuated
the
applicability of Inform’s work and services in all
faith communities. Following Beckley was Henri
de Cordes, the former President of Belgium’s
CIAOSN, an organisation which acts as a junior
sibling to the “grown-up” Inform. De Cordes
specified how the two organisations have exis-
ted as key players in a mutually beneficial aca-
demic microcosm. The next speaker was retired
civil servant Hugh Marriage. As an instrumental
figure in the securing of Inform’s first govern-
ment grants, Marriage detailed how his own de-
partment within the Home Office which was
initially responsible for ‘cult’ management was
grossly underinformed – until Inform became in-
volved in an advisory position. As a member of
the
Estonian
Ministry of
the
Interior with
twenty-five years of history with Inform, Ringo
Ringvee then emulated Marriage’s experience in
an international context. Retired solicitor Kim
Speller then highlighted how he had personally
sought the informed testimonies of several In-
form members to aid in numerous childcare
cases concerning wardship in the wider familial
context of a New Religious Movement. This
panel closed with the words of Jim Walters, dir-
ector of the LSE Faith Centre. With the aid of In-
form, Walters highlighted how he is now able to
appreciate the complex intersectionality of the
ways “big religion” can inform “small religion,”
and vice versa. This panel was both necessary
and enlightening in terms of contextualising In-
form in spheres that lie outside of academia.

The final panel was delivered online, and saw
three American scholars beam into the pro-
ceedings. The first of these was Gordon Melton,
who stressed the importance of fieldwork in re-
ligious studies, claiming that it is amongst the
worst of trends in modern religious studies to
neglect its importance. Susan Palmer then
spoke of the equal status that Inform gives to
members of NRMs alongside academics and
officials, thus providing a space for product
conversation to take place. The last speaker
was Catherine Wessinger, who echoed many of
the sentiments expressed throughout the day.


## Page 9

Wessinger’s speech concluded with a personal
plea to both Melton and Barker to write and re-
flect collaboratively on “the influence they’ve had
over
NRMs
behind
the
scenes.”
Wessinger
praised the organisation for the important work
that it has done, and will continue to do.

Inform’s 35th anniversary seminar proved to be
an event which was as inspiring as it was honor-
ary of both Professor Barker and Inform itself, ac-
curately managing to balance a reverence for the
established legacy of the charity and optimistic
postulation as to what Inform may go on to be-
come over its next thirty-five years of existence.
It is thanks to the enlightening, touching, and of-
ten humorous tales of those in attendance that
the legacy of Professor Barker and Inform could
be properly honoured and celebrated, in an event
that truly highlighted Inform as a meeting place
for open, productive conversation between aca-
demics and those associated with a range of
New Religious Movements.

IAHR SPECIAL CONFERENCE
UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO, DECEMBER 2023

“Can the IAHR be engaged and relevant without
being political or confessional? The position of
“science (wissenschaft)” in 2023.”

This conference was convened in response to
three recent debates within the IAHR—the ongo-
ing debate regarding updating the constitution
and potentially the name of the IAHR in light of
developments since the Marburg statement of
1960; the resulting debate about the relationship
between the study of religion and different con-
ceptions of “science”; and the recent statement
in support of the Ukrainian Association, an unpre-
cedented political intervention from the associ-
ation. Details of the first two points, including
discussion of the debates to date, can be found
in previous BASR Bulletin issues 140 (June 2022,
12-13) and 139 (November 2021, 17-20), as well

as the IAHR e-Bulletin Supplement (November
2019). I’m sure that readers will forgive me for
not rehashing the sometimes-heated debate
again here, beyond the necessary background
context.

The conference opened with welcome addresses
from IAHR President Tim Jensen and Satoko Fuji-
wara, Secretary General of the IAHR and Presid-
ent of the Japanese Association (JARS), and who
also organised the conference. This was followed
by the keynote from Nancy Cartwright—not the
one from The Simpsons, the one from Durham
University who is President of the International
Union of History and Philosophy of Science and
Technology. Her presentation, “Objectivity, Values
and Commitment in Science” (presented re-
motely, though with numerous slides) was a mas-
terful overview of the current position(s) of
philosophers of science in regard to “objectivity”,
“positivism” and “science”, and how different dis-
ciplines (both STEM and social science) are grap-
pling with similar issues to Religious Studies.

Two questions in particular came to the fore.
First, is science singular, or plural? Cartwright ex-
plained that in her field, “today, virtually no-one
believes that there is a purely formal scientific
method”, and introduced us to three of the most
significant contemporary approaches to under-
standing how much we can actually know about
material reality. Scientific Perspectivism, associ-
ated with Ronald Giere, attempts to mediate
between objectivism and constructivism by ar-
guing that while claims can be true in a qualified
and conditional sense, they cannot be proven in
any absolute sense, as rather they are always
properties of the interaction between the mater-
ial world and human observers. Pragmatic Real-
ism, associated with Hasok Chang, agrees that
universal truths about material reality are im-
possible, and proposes a practice-based ap-
proach based on what we do with science in
which a statement can be considered true to the
extent that it works coherently with other activ-
ities to achieve our aims. As such, knowledge is
regarded as an ability rather than something that
one simply possesses. Lastly, Standpoint Theory,
associated with philosopher of science Alison
Wylie, argues that knowledge production is situ-


## Page 10

ated within a hierarchical structure of power re-
lations, and is conducted by individuals whose
experience and social context shapes what
they know and how they know it. Yet marginal-
ized groups (the “outsiders within”) can have an
epistemic advantage by offering perspectives
that challenge dominant paradigms, thus con-
tributing to a more comprehensive understand-
ing of the world. It was enlightening to see that
other disciplines are wrestling with the same
questions, but as I have been arguing for a few
years now, as a discipline framing itself as a sci-
ence, and dealing with claims about “belief”,
“faith”, even “Truth”, Religious Studies is long
overdue in addressing our epistemic contradic-
tions and evasions. It was encouraging there-
fore
to
hear
these
issues
being
directly
addressed
in
responses
from Jeppe Jensen (Aar-
hus) from a critical
per-
spective,
and
Kevin
Schilbrack
(Appalachian
State) from the perspect-
ive of philosophy of religion.

The Roundtable Session at
the end of the first day in-
cluded
a
speaker
from
every continent bar Antarc-
tica, representing the USA,
Mexico, South Africa, Bangladesh, Japan and
the UK. Each was asked to give a ten-minute
presentation addressing any combination of the
conferences key questions as they saw fit.
What was remarkable was how much agree-
ment and overlap there was between the pa-
pers, given that there was no prior coordination
between them. Amy Allocco, from Elon Uni-
versity, North Carolina, discussed how the AAR
have sponsored initiatives designed to promote
the positive effects of religious diversity, as
well as making political statements, so long as
they advance their mission to enhance the pub-
lic understanding of religion. Blanca Solares
Altamirano, from the National Autonomous Uni-
versity of Mexico, reflected on the roots of the
IAHR in the Eranos circle, and asked how the
study of religion might contribute to under-
standing “the spiritual crisis or loss of meaning
in our days?”

Denzil Chetty, from the University of South

Africa, delivered for me the standout paper, ad-
dressing “knowledge inequalities and its situ-
ational dynamics” from the perspective of the
Global South. Whose knowledge, whose sci-
ence, does the study of religion qua science de-
fend? Prof. Shahnaj Jahan, from the University
of Liberal Arts Bangladesh, talked about ap-
proaching the question as an archaeologist,
where the focus on material objects means
that there is little space for confessional con-
cerns. The problem is not the name, she argued,
but that we must be firmer with our colleagues
on this position, and better at communicating it
to the public. And so, I felt more confident in ar-
guing in my paper that, whatever else it may be,
religion is a political term, and that the critical
turn is essential to globalising the study of reli-

gion and making space
for
other
knowledge
formations.
The
final
presenter was Shusuke
Yamane, now of the Na-
tional Institute of Tech-
nology, Maizuru College,
Japan. A graduate of the
so-called Kyoto School of
the
philosophy of
reli-
gion, who argued vehe-
mently
against
the
inclusion
of
the
word
“science” into the constitution, Dr Yamane drew
on William James to argue against this, for a
more pragmatic theory of truth.

The second day began with an open panel of pa-
pers. This was a somewhat eclectic and uneven
selection, with some presentations wildly mis-
judged in terms of content, level and political
rhetoric. But there was a superb presentation
from
IAHR Treasurer, Andrea
Rota,
entitled
“Neutral. All too Neutral? Contemporary (?)
Challenges in the Study of Religion”. Echoing
the panel of delegates from the previous after-
noon (again, without planning), he called for “a
decolonial theory of religion” approached as an
“ecology of knowledge”, and laid out three
methodological maxims to achieve this: 1) axi-
ological neutrality (excluding evaluative value
judgements),
2)
methodological
naturalism
(which to me seems clearer and more accurate
than
“methodological
agnosticism”);
and
3)
“suspension of truth statements”.

After lunch, the final panel was work-in-progress
presentations from PhD candidates at the Uni-
versity of Tokyo’s Religion department. Aya Oba
introduced their research among monks using a
Death Studies approach. Aki Murakami presen-
ted fascinating research looking at the relation-
ship between RS and Buddhist theology in
Japan—which had striking parallels with the UK
situation. Mina Lee was next, presenting her re-
search among Jewish communities in Korean
ghettos. She was also brave enough to directly
refer to Gaza, which shamefully few of her more
secure colleagues were. Hiroki Tanaka gave an
impressively
theoretically
sophisticated
presentation comparing secularism in France
and Japan, with a focus on public scholarship and
anti-cult rhetoric. Ikuo Tsuboko closed with an
eloquent
presentation
on
the
relationship
between “scientific” and “confessional” studies,
focussing on the work of Charles Taylor. The
standard of the presentations was high across
the board, speaking to the quality of teaching in
the faculty.

This was followed by the International Commit-
tee Meeting (the contents of which we will leave
to the IAHR Bulletin to relay), and the conference
closed. But for the international delegates, the
organising committee had arranged two trips,
beginning the following morning—a one-day tour
of sites in Tokyo, and a three-day tour to Kyoto.
For those staying in Tokyo, our attentive student
guides took us to several Shinto shrines, includ-
ing the Meiji Jingu shrine, dedicated to the Meiji
royal family, where we were given an excellent
personalised tour by a Shinto priest, the beauti-
ful Tsukiji Honganji Pure Land Buddhist Temple
whose fittings and architecture mixed Indian and
Japanese
motifs,
and
the
bustling
Sensoji
Temple, by the famous Kaminarimon Gate and
Nakamise shopping street, where we were taken
into the inner temple by the priests. Perhaps the
highlight, however, was a visit to the headquar-
ters of Soka Gakkai International, where we were
treated to lunch, a presentation on the group’s
peace lobbying and an audience with SGI Direct-
or General for Peace and Global Issues Hirotsugu
Terasaki. While the atmosphere was more akin to
a corporate boardroom meeting than temple, we

were all impressed by Terasaki’s direct but meas-
ured answers to our questions.

The group that went on the three-day Kyoto trip,
led by Professor Satoko Fujiwara and assisted by
several students, took the train past a stunning
view of Mount Fuji and visited mainly a wide se-
lection of different Buddhist sites, including the
famed Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku-ji), seeing differ-
ent styles of gardens (water, moss and dry), as
well as a temple complex with an impressive col-
lection of bonzai trees. Some Buddhist sites em-
braced
new technology in
the
form
of an
‘android’ bodhisattva (Kannon) speaking lines
from the Heart Sutra and small Buddhas at-
tached to drones inspired by raigō paintings de-
picting the descent of Amida Buddha on a purple
cloud to take deceased believers to the Western
Paradise.
There
was
such
a
variety,
even
between different Pure Land groups, making it
impossible to characterise Japanese Buddhism
as a whole.

A full transcript of the international panel will be
published in a forthcoming IAHR eBulletin, and
the conference proceedings will form the basis
of a future volume of Equinox’s IAHR Book
Series.

A note on a new archival resource at
The New Library, Llanilltud Fawr/Llantwit Major

Many Bulletin readers will remember the late Dr. Terry (D.A.T) Thomas (1931-2011) as a warm and long- serving colleague in BASR and in the Religious Studies department at The Open University. I was fortunate to be supervised as a PhD student by Terry between 1994 and 1996. Terry was BASR secretary from 1987 to 1993 and the founding editor of the BASR Occasional Paper series in 1991, and worked hard to promote the association and spread the message of the value of the Study of Religion/s as a disciplinary field. He was ap- pointed Staff Tutor in Religious Studies at The Open University in Wales in 1971 where he taught for 25 years and where he was involved in the production of the pioneering course ‘Man’s Religious Quest’ in 1978 and later ‘The Growth of Religious Diversity’ and ‘Religion in Victorian Britain’. In 1988 he edited The British: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices 1800-1986 for John Hinnells’ and Ninian Smart’s series ‘The Library of Reli- gious Beliefs and Practices’ and a revised version of his 1983 doctoral thesis at the University of Notting- ham was published in 1999 as Paul Tillich and World Religions (for more details, see the tribute by Beckerlegge, Chryssides and Sutcliffe 2011 plus Terence Thomas Bibliography 2011).

A small personal archive of Terry’s early papers has now been lodged with The New Library and will in due course become available to researchers interested in Terry’s work and in related matters on the history of BASR and the Study of Religion/s in the UK. It all began with a communication in 2021 from Terry’s son, Huw Thomas, to Stephen Gregg, BASR President. Stephen passed on the query to me as one of Terry’s final PhD students. Since Terry’s PhD had analysed Paul Tillich’s thought, especially in relation to ‘world religions’ (Thomas 1999), I initially contacted the Paul Tillich Society in the US. They were keen but unable to accept an analogue archive. Dr Russell Re Manning then kindly put me in touch with Richard Parry, founder of The New Library. The rest, as they say, is (recent) history.

Most of the archive contents sorted into

The archive consists in paper documents mainly connected one way or another with the work of the Ger- man-American philosophical theologian, Paul Tillich (1886-1965): for example, notes made by Terry from Tillich’s papers, copies of Terry’s papers given at associated conferences and correspondence with the Tillich Society.

There is also scattered wider correspondence (sometimes quite brief) including with Thomas J.J. Altizer, Mircea Eliade, Michael Pye and John Heywood Thomas. There is not much on Terry’s later interests in methodology and disciplinary formation in the Study of Religions (Thomas 1984) and in the historical so- ciology of religious diversity (Thomas 1988) so the archive must be seen as a very particular slice of Terry’s scholarship. A further shift in Terry’s interests came after he retired from the Open University in 1996 and became increasingly interested in the new cognitive science of religion and in naturalist ex- planatory theories of religion. An autobiographical fragment in my possession poignantly documents this personal shift over the decades from the Tillichian theology of his early career to naturalism and atheism.

It’s important to see this archive in context: in the first place, as the early fruits of a particular, ‘local’ (Welsh) biography - Terry was a Welsh speaker - within a UK history of the study of religion/s in the wake of the pivotal ‘turn’ at Lancaster and elsewhere in the late 1960s; secondly, as the early steps in an intel- lectual journey from a theology of culture and interfaith encounter, to historical sociology, and finally to a naturalistic model of religion. Along the way, like many other British contemporaries, Terry engaged en- thusiastically with the international scene: for example, he was a participant at the select 1988 confer- ence in Marburg on the disciplinary shape of the Study of Religion/s (Pye 1989) and he analysed the politics of late Victorian studies of religion at the IAHR congress in Mexico City (Thomas 2000).

This new archive therefore is a valuable resource which documents the early research formation of an important scholar in the Study of Religion/s at both UK and international levels. It provides a fascinating new piece in the complex jigsaw of our field and reminds us of the value of disciplinary historiography for understanding where we are now. And if we don’t write our own history someone else may do it for us.

Teaching about religion and the climate crisis:

A specificallyreligious studies approach

The climate emergency is one of the defining moral and social issues of our time. Proper under- standing of it must involve appreciation of the role that religion(s) play(s) in where we are now, and in our responses to the crisis. It is therefore increasingly important for curricula of religious studies departments to find engaging and relevant ways of addressing both the climate crisis itself and re- lated issues of human relationships with the natural world.

However, in designing religious studies curricula about the climate crisis, there are certain traps that are easy to fall into, and that mirror the wider challenges facing our discipline. First is the danger of leaning too heavily into engaging with religious arguments. It is easy to see how this can lead to discussions that are primarily theological and/or that privilege Christianity. Alternatively, in then focusing on the responses of non-Christian and/or non-Western religious communities, we can end up pivoting towards a world religions paradigm, or even a kind of tokenising orientialism. Either way, there is a danger of privileging top-down structures at the expense of personal religious exper- ience. How best to approach teaching about religion and the environment in order to avoid these dangers?

Based on a course I taught at The University of Edinburgh, this article discusses three inter-related dimensions of teaching about religion and the climate crisis. These are: (1) modeling nature and the climate; (2) subjective responses to crisis: and (3) political, structural and social issues. A course can bring together a variety of case studies that focus on aspects of each of these three dimen- sions, highlighting the ways in which they interweave. This will provide a deep, inter-disciplinary but RS-led understanding of the intersection between religion and the climate crisis, which students can then develop in ways that are appropriate to them. The following sections provide some ex- ample suggestions on how each of these themes might be approached so as to emphasise the connections between them.

Modelling nature and the climate

This theme looks at the ways people in various contexts frame nature and the natural world, to make it something that they can understand on their own terms, relate to, and perhaps influence. Firstly, how do people respond to the inherent power of nature, both as a destructive force and as a sustainer of life? Case studies illustrate how anthropomorphising nature can provide a way of mod- elling its patterns as personality, and as a route to forming a constructive relationship with it. This can be compared with enlightenment trends towards rationalising and instrumentalizing nature through measurement and experimentation (Golinski 2019), and the later trend towards romanti- cisation that leant into radical acceptance of nature as an uncanny, dangerous and disruptive force that is intricately tied to our vulnerability as living beings (Mayer 2018).

Building on these initial themes, we can then explore how people model and justify their sense of moral obligation toward nature. Notions of human dominion over nature can be discussed not only in terms of theological justifications but also in terms of their utilisation as a way of under- pinning and justifying racist attitudes and colonial power. The paradigm of stewardship over nature that has more recently become prominent in religious environmentalism can be dis- cussed as a way of recasting dominion as responsibility to better suit modernity and its environ- mentalist concerns (Chaplin 2016), while still maintaining something of its theological and anthropocentric core. These paradigms can be further explored by comparison with notions of kinship with nature, which provides an emphasis on interconnectivity and uses personhood as a way of developing an attitude of relational empathy with aspects of the natural world (Rountree 2012).

Subjective responses to nature and the crisis

This theme explores the place of personal, sub-
jective and spiritual responses in mediating our
feelings about nature and subsequently also our
response to the climate emergency. I have found
this an especially valuable theme, because of
the opportunities it affords to use students’
own subjective responses to nature to help
them engage critically but also empathetically
with a range of responses to nature and the cli-
mate crisis. Individual and group reflection on
exercises like the Deep Time Walk and the Sit-
Spot exercise have been especially valuable for
this. They can help underpin exploration of a
range of topics.

Firstly, eco-spirituality can be thought of as a
sense of profound and motivating personal con-
nection with nature or particular elements of
nature. Numerous aspects of eco-spirituality
can be explored, including (for example) how the
British road protesters formed a sense of em-
bodied connection with nature in a kind of un-
tutored grassroots eco-paganism that helped to
underpin their protests (Harris 2014), and how
surfers have developed a kind of informal aquat-
ic religion based on a sense of personal connec-
tion with the ocean, that has in turn served to
bring them together as a community (Taylor 2010).

But also, subjectivity is important in helping us to understand the profound impact that climate anxiety can have on people and communities, and the role of religion and spirituality in mediating responses to this. One response can be for communities to develop a kind of unspoken social contract to ignore the problem and carry on as normal (Pihkala 2018). Alternatively, a profound and debilitating sense of loss can develop (Albrecht 2019). Responses can develop predicated on (for example) hope, denial, radical acceptance, or attempting to develop a relationship of constructive empathy with nature (Haraway 2016).

The Deep Time Walk
www.deeptimewalk.org

This “walking audio history of the living
Earth” was developed by educators at
Schumacher College. Participants walk
4.6km, while listening to an audio play
through their mobile phone. This leads
them
through
the
4.6
billion
year
history of the Earth at a rate of one
million years per metre walked, while
encouraging
reflection
on
various
aspects of deep time. Topics covered
include the timescales of the earth in
relation to human timescales, and how
humans
relate
to
and
impact
the
natural
world.
The
listener
is
also
encouraged to empathise with various
elements of the natural world.

Political and social issues

This theme explores some social and political
aspects of our relationship with nature and en-
vironmentalism,
especially with
respect
to
gender, race, and indigeneity. It allows us to
probe how relations of power can mirror and
mutually reinforce how we construct our rela-
tionship with the natural world.

With respect to gender, one useful case study is the relationship of British ecofeminism with political protest movements of the late twenti- eth century and with the Goddess movement, and subsequent debates around essentialism (Gaard 2011). Another is the Chipko movement of 1970s India, which facilitates discussion of a grassroots conservation movement with col- lective women’s leadership and built on sacral- ity of the local forest (Vandana 2016). Discussion of environmentalism in the United States allows us to explore not only how envir- onmentalist narratives based around white ex- perience can alienate and exclude other ethnicities (Carter 2020), but also how aca- demia itself can overlook and deprivilege cul- tural environmentalism in non-white cultures (Baugh 2020). However, discussion of eco-Wo- manism enables exploration of the development of a radically inclusive spiritual ecological praxis from the lived experience of black women in the United States (Maparyan 2016), also linking to ideas of intersectionality.

Another important area is indigeneity, how we think about our relationship with the land, and various religion-related claims to land rights. Discussion might focus on how colonial narratives based on Christian ideas of dominion have facilitated the alienation of communities from their rights to their land (Berne Burow et al 2018), and how decolonization seeks the problematization and dismantling of such narratives. Comparative case studies can include the protests around the Alta Dam and the Dakota Pipeline (Kraft 2020).

Conclusion

Linking together these three themes using case studies such as the ones mentioned above provides an especially potent opportunity for exploring how religion and religious narratives me- diate between individual spiritual experience, religious communities, and a wide range of social and political issues. This kind of specifically religious studies led approach helps students to critically reflect on their own experience, and also develop an empathetic yet critical personal response to climate justice, the natural world, and wider societal concerns.

The Sit-Spot Exercise

spot-and-how-do-you-do-it/

This exercise was originally developed
by Jon Young to help people develop
and
experience
an
empathetic
relationship with specific elements of
nature. It involves choosing an easily
accessible personal space in which to
sit for a short time every day to spend
time with nature, cultivating a sense of
mindful empathy with the elements of
that space. Students can continue the
practice for as long as feels useful to
them
and
critically
reflect
on
the
experience.
This
provides
useful
subjective
context
for
discussions
around eco-spirituality.

The World Religions paradigm revisited

I think the readers of this Bulletin are very familiar with the way that the word "religion" and "world religions" have been problematized by scholars of religious studies. The word "religion" originally meant something close to the present day meaning of piety or righteousness. The later use of it by (mainly) European Christians to mean a system of beliefs and practices held by a group of people arose during the 19th century as an accommodation to a growing awareness, especially among co- lonial powers, that other peoples had sophisticated systems of practices and beliefs. Thus this concept of religion emerged within a particular Eurocentric historical and cultural concept. It was largely the result of the worldview of those scholars who wrote on this subject in the 19th century. By prioritising scripture and theology (rather than, say, holy law or mystical experience) as being the core of "religion", these scholars were able to build up a worldview in which there was hierarchy of religions with Christianity at the top as the most advanced and highly evolved religion; montheistic religions with a scripture were next down the hierarchy (Judaism and Islam); next were religions with a scripture, beliefs and a civilization (Hinduism and Buddhism). These were the "Big Five". Other reli- gions such as the archaic religions of Greece, Rome and the Fertile Crescent were valued because of the light they shed on Christianity. On the lowest rung of the ladder were the "primitive" (including pre-Christian European) religions of the native peoples of the world. The concept "religion" became, in the 19th century, a tool of colonialism, creating a normative worldview that cast Europe and Christianity as the apex of civilization and thus justifying the colonialist enterprise of "civilizing" the rest of the world. This was a way of exercising power and a justification for the use of force. In the 20th century, an effort was made to reduce the triumphalism of the concept of religions as con- ceived in the 19th century. Out of this the "World Religions" paradigm was conceived by Ninian Smart and others in an attempt to be pluralistic. But this paradigm also had hidden colonialist as- pects – the topics under which each religion was descibed were drawn from Chritianity.

A paradigmatic example of this concept of "a religion" occurred in India. When the British came to In- dia, they were faced with an extraordinarily diverse and seemingly chaotic array of practices, some of which could be identified from within the British mindset as religious, but others where is was dif- ficult (and usually unhelpful) to distinguish "religious" traditions from social, family or tribal ritual and traditions. Most of these practices were local and had little in the way of elaborated belief systems associated with them, but some were supra-local and these usually had a more elaborate belief sys- tem. The resolution of this was to create an artificial religion-secular divide and then to call the reli- gion part of this divide "Hindu", a term that was originally (as Hind or al-Hind) a geographical one assigned to the lands beyond the Sindh river by Iranians and later by Muslim conquerers, and only gradually came to be used to designate their religious beliefs. Even then, it originally referred non- specifically to those residents of India (or more specifically northern India) who were not Muslims, and it did not describe any specific religious practices or beliefs.

The creation of a religion called "Hinduism" stems mostly from the efforts of Western scholars to fit the culture of India into a pre-conceived Western pattern of "religions". To a large extent, they had a pre-conception of religions as having scripture, a priestly class, a theology of salvation and con- cepts of an after-life, and so they picked out a textualized, Brahmanical Hinduism and made this into the "religion" of India, whereas in fact it did not fit with the practices of the majority of the inhabit-

ants of the sub-continent. Indeed as Timothy Fitzgerald commented, the putative religion "Hinduism" is perhaps located "more in secular universities in Euro America than in Indian vil- lages." At best it was "a Europeanised version of the dominant Brahmanical ideology" and of little relevance to the villagers who made up the vast majority of India's population. A parallel process occured with the other cultures of the world, including Japanese, Chinese, African and native American.

Following on from this, scholars of religion, such as Tomoko Masuzawa, Suzanne Owen and James Cox have considered the concept of "religion" and its derivative "world religion" as an es- sentialising and problematic construct; a reification that constrains a rich and diverse human experience into a narrow Eurocentric and Eurohegemonic framework. They have suggested al- ternative frameworks for studying and teaching this phenomenon.

I want to make it clear that I have no problem with this line of thinking and my intention is not to contradict any of their findings or to push back against this trend. I do however have a problem with one result of this line of research. Whether scholars like it or not, large numbers of people across the world now see their identity in terms of the World Religion paradigm. In India, for ex- ample, the majority of the educated population consider themselves as belonging to a religion called Hinduism. The process of the "Brahmanization" or "Sanskritization" of the vast variety of local deities and religious practices is well under way. And of course the politicization of Hinduism in the form of aggressively Hindu political parties is having a major impact on the coun- try. A parallel process is going on in the Islamic world culminating in the rise of political Islam, with Buddhism in Sri Lanka, and many other examples. In the United Kingdom, the existence of such organizations as the Hindu Council UK, Muslim Council of Britain, and Network of Buddhist Organisations is evidence that the World Religions Paradigm is deeply entrenched in the con- sciousness of these communities. It is a source of identity for large numbers of people.

Thus the concept of "religions" and "world religions" began as an academic exercise by white (mainly male) scholars in 19th century Europe, but an exercise with a colonialist and hegemonic background and consequences. It has now however been thoroughly taken on board by many millions of people who self-identity as one of these "world religions". The theorizing of 19th Cen- tury Western scholars has become a lived reality throughout the world. Would telling the rest of the world that they have identified with an imposed illusory construct (in effect, that what they think is their reality is false) not be replacing 19th Century colonialism with a neo-colonialist turn be a hegemonic exercise in telling people who they are and what they should be thinking?

meet the members

I first became acquainted with BASR in 1992, at the invitation of Terry Thomas, who was then the secretary, and who was trying to boost the organisation’s dwindling membership. There were only twelve of us who met for the annual meeting at King Alfred’s College (now the University of Winchester), but Terry succeeded in getting the organisation to grow rapidly. I became the Bulletin editor from 2002 to 2006, and was made an Honorary Member in 2009, after retiring from the Uni- versity of Wolverhampton the previous year.

I was a part-time tutor for the Open University, in which Terry was part of its Religious Studies team, and who helped to pioneer the “Man’s Religious Quest” course, subsequently renamed “The Religious Quest”. Terry was keen to encourage students to undertake fieldwork, which was new to me at the time. Since there were few religious communities other than Christian churches in Plymouth, where I was then living, a weekend in London became an annual event for my students, when we visited Jew- ish, Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim and Sikh organisations.

Fieldwork was much easier when I moved to Wolverhampton in 1992. When I inaugurated a module on new religious movements, I was determined that fieldwork should be an important part of students’ study. The Jehovah’s Witnesses’ City Overseer was particularly helpful to us, and was instrumental in sparking my own interest in the Watchtower organisation, which had been unduly neglected in aca- demic study, and on which much of my work now focuses.

What do I like about it BASR? It’s a friendly, supportive organisation, where it’s good to meet up with old friends and new researchers, to showcase parts of one’s own work and to keep abreast of what others are doing. I’m a regular attender at its annual conference, having only missed one meeting since my first one.

I joined the BASR as a postgraduate student and attended my first BASR conference in 2003 at Uni- versity College Chester, as it was then, where I gave a ‘lightning talk’, as part of a works-in-progress panel, on a debate about researching Native American religious traditions. James Cox, my supervisor, was then the Honorary Secretary of the BASR, the position I hold currently. I enjoyed the conference and had hoped to return for the next one. However, as a postgraduate on a limited budget, the next BASR conference I could attend was in 2006 at Bath Spa. I don’t think I’ve missed one since.

From 2013 to 2022, I was the coordinating editor of DISKUS, the Journal of the British Association for the Study of Religions (now JBASR), the first publication venue for many of us. My article, ‘The Pro- duction of Sacred Space in the Mi’kmaq Powwow’ (DISKUS 11 [2010]), was inspired by Kim Knott’s presentation at a BASR conference applying Henri Lefebvre’s spatial analysis to the study of religion.

During my PhD studies, I was aware that I would find it difficult to get a post in Religious Studies be- cause I wasn’t researching a ‘world religion’. With that in mind, I became a tutor in three subject areas at Edinburgh: Religious Studies, Canadian Studies and Social Anthropology, and researched as much as I could on methodological aspects of studying religion. The problem was, most positions advert- ised in Religious Studies stated a preference for a specialist in a ‘world religion’. Often, in the UK at least, positions went to people without a Religious Studies degree, making it all the more frustrating. However, just as I was finishing my PhD, I was lucky to get a Teaching Fellowship in World Religions at the University of St Andrews, which no doubt helped me get the part-time lecturing position at Leeds Trinity (though I was the second-choice candidate). Two of the modules I was given to teach were World Religions 1 and World Religions 2. A little exasperated, I presented a short paper on the issue at the University of Stirling and was persuaded to publish it as an article (‘The World Religions paradigm: Time for a change’, 2011). Eventually, I was able to change the modules, dropping any mention of ‘world religions’ except as a topic examining the influence of this type of categorisation.

I am thankful to the BASR for providing a space to explore ways we might teach and research ‘religion’ beyond the artificial boundaries persistent in our field, and also for the fellowship, making the confer- ence seem more like a holiday or an annual meet-up of friends.

DOMBLÉ IN A BRAZILIAN CITY. ROUTLEDGE. IX

3.

“Ambivalence” – a synonym for uncertainty,
doubt and inconclusiveness – stands right at
the centre of this intriguing volume. Where once
we moderns knew all about religion, now it
seems, the architecture has changed.

The subtitle of the intro-
ductory
chapter
is,
‘The
confusing
religious
land-
scape in Brazil’, and it opens
with two quotes from in-
terviews conducted by the
authors in the city of Belo
Horizontale that strike right
to the heart of any sense
of stable ground. The first
interviewee
says,
“I
am
evangelistic, but I do not
like to follow the church’s
doctrines”
while
the
second states, “I do not go
to church … I do not have
any religion. I believe in God,
not a religion” (p. 1). Later,
we are furnished with stat-
istics
about
Brazil’s
reli-
gious populations including
Census data specifying numbers of Catholics
and Protestants (pp. 51-2; see also p. 4), as well
as maps detailing the distributions of religious
infrastructures in Belo Horizontale (pp. 55-64).
Perhaps we are on solid ground after all. At one
level, it is no surprise, given Brazil’s colonial his-
tory, that the majority of Brazilians identify as
Catholic. Catholic places of worship have played
a structuring role in colonial urbanism; they oc-
cupy key locations in the planned urban fabric

predominantly in the older, more established
neighbourhoods of towns and cities, and Belo
Horizontale is no exception (p. 5 and p. 60). And,
amidst the demolitions, renovations and new
developments of the city, the Catholic Church
has, unsurprisingly, exerted a gravitational force
not merely upon the shape and texture of urban
space in Brazil, but in the very definition of ‘reli-
gion’ itself, including in the idea that Candomblé
and other Afro-Brazilian religions are evil. But
with significant decreases among those identi-
fying as Catholic in the Southeast of the coun-
try (p. 52), the presence of temples is no

guarantee for the presence
of worshippers (according to
one study conducted in Rio
de Janeiro in the late 1990s,
only 18% of Catholics at-
tend
church
on
a weekly
basis, p. 92).

By
contrast,
Pentecostal,
charismatic and evangelical
populations are growing na-
tionally
and
in
Belo
Hori-
zontale, their infrastructures
spreading in areas of new
and often precarious urban
development
for
example
along
“major
traffic
cor-
ridors” (p. 59) as well as at
the peripheries of the city, in
rented spaces and in re-pur-
posed older buildings “where
the Brazilian State has been absent in providing
basic services” (p. 103), although they are also
sometimes built from scratch to compete “for
symbolic dominance” (p. 62), such as the main
church of the Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus
(IURD). But evangelical success in areas experi-
encing rapid urban change also points to “fluid
loyalty among Protestants, with many … at-
tending different temples or switching between
churches” (p. 54) as well as “a more informal and

ephemeral territorialisation within urban areas”
with Pentecostal churches often showing signs
of “recent renovations, [and] makeshift con-
struction solutions” (p. 56), suggesting simul-
taneously a vibrant and elusive urban footprint.
Moreover, the fact that Pentecostal groups mo-
bilise television among a range of media includ-
ing also radio stations and newspapers as well
as content on digital platforms, points to anoth-
er index of the spatial, albeit one not tied down
to any conventionally emnbodied materialisation
of urban experience.

Finally, the infrastructures of other religions
such as Candomblé and Umbanda are often in-
visible, as their spaces typically lack external,
identifying features and their practices depend
on oral (rather than textual) sources for trans-
mission and are also often shrouded in secrecy
(p.95). Yet in the Concórdia neighbourhood of
the city, which has a substantial black popula-
tion, the terreiros are discernible (p. 64). This se-
lective visibility is compounded by the “syncretic
strategies” (p. 27) of Afro-Brazilian religions
which in some instances “self-describe as part
of the Catholic Church” (p. 53) but in any case,
are typically moving blends of practices, materi-
als and ideas drawn from a variety of cultural and
religious resources, constituted at least in part
by historical experiences of racism and econom-
ic inequality.

Central to this study in uncertainty are the
trans-disciplinary
methods
of
the
research
team, which are summarised in the final chapter
as a “phenomenological-hermeneutical-decolo-
nial approach” (p. 98). One might question the
preponderance of classical scholarship from the
Global North that frames key points of orienta-
tion in the book, notably Mircea Eliade and Pierre
Bourdieu but also Simmel and Lefebvre, even if
none of them would have approved of this
book’s embrace of uncertainty. Towards the end
of the research project the team goes back to
the field and to some of their interviewees, “to
return part of the knowledge shared with these
people and [to] understand their thoughts about
our arguments. We strive[d] to ensure that we
… [were] not creating a narrative that does not
relate
to
the
reality
of
their
experiences.
However, the discussions only partly addressed
our arguments, [and] instead tended to open

new paths of inquiry and ask further questions.
It made us realise that our research will not end
…” (p. 98-9). The research questions and argu-
ments, then, did not reveal an exquisitely delim-
ited and detailed field of study or advance new
empirical data framed and made newly access-
ible by an innovative theoretical model. “While
conversing with people, we gained a deep under-
standing … but when we turned to writing, we
found ourselves slowly losing this understand-
ing” (p. 104). In the spirit of indeterminacy and
deconstruction the final chapter includes a ref-
erence to Babel, the demolition of which cuts
humans off from the promise of perfect inter-
subjective understanding, and condemns them
to the labour of translation and interpretation, to
which this book is testament.

Dawn-Marie Gibson has authored several im-
portant texts on the Nation of Islam, which have
aided greatly our understanding of the move-
ment. In this new book she tackles the contro-
versial and little understood figure of Louis
Farrakhan, leader of the NOI since he revived the
original Nation in 1979.

Farrakhan is as much a myth as a man. For many
of us the myth overtakes any conception of him
as a person. Still, this is a short and easily di-
gestible book. Beginning with a necessary over-
view of the history of the NOI, and its critical
personnel – Wallace Fard Muhammad, Elijah
Muhammad,
Malcolm
X
–
Gibson
leads
us
through the evolution of Louis Walcott into the
original NOI’s Minister Louis X and then into
Louis Farrakhan, leader of the revived NOI.

From Malcolm X’s acrimonious departure in
1963 until Elijah Muhammad’s death in 1975,
Farrakhan was effectively second-in-command
of the original NOI, his militant passion and ded-


## Page 23

ication to the cause of African Americans via the
mythology and approach of the NOI replicating
that of the lost frontman. In some important
ways Farrakhan’s background reflects that of
Malcolm X. X was born to a West Indian mother
and African American father who were commit-
ted Garveyites; Farrakhan was born in 1933 to a
West Indian immigrant single parent, Sarah Man-
ning, who herself was a Garveyite and later fol-
lower
of
Elijah
Muhammad.
Several
factors
embedded a deep conservatism in him: as well
as the gender role expectations of early 20th
century Black America and Garveyism, his father
was a philanderer who Manning left her husband
for, but played no role in Louis’s life. Unlike X
however, Farrakhan ap-
pears to have been a
content and committed
Christian
prior
to
his
conversion
–
brought
about by explicit target-
ing
from
Elijah
Muhammad,
who
per-
ceived
something
im-
portant within him.

The story of Farrakhan is
a fascinating one – the
pivot of which is his be-
ing passed over to lead
the
NOI
after
Elijah
Muhammad’s
death
in
1975,
in
favour
of
Muhammad’s
son
(and
FBI choice), Warith Deen
– who led the NOI quickly
away from the peculiarly
Fardian
(and
peculiarly
Black
American)
as-
pects, into Islamic Sunni
orthodoxy. Farrakhan first ceded to Warith Deen,
then left to revive his music career, before find-
ing himself compelled to revive the NOI in its ori-
ginal form. He even claimed that Elijah had been
taken by God and was not dead.

It would be difficult to author any book on Far-
rakhan, or the NOI, without mentioning the per-
sistent allegations of antisemitism. These, and
his rejection of them, are mentioned in the
book’s second sentence; the subject consti-
tutes a fair proportion of Gibson’s index refer-

ences and a dedicated subsection (pp.97-102).
Indeed, a full investigation of the history of the
Nation of Islam’s antisemitic rhetoric, accusa-
tions, and defences awaits writing. In Malcolm
X’s infamous meetings with the KKK it was dis-
like for Jews over which they apparently bonded;
it also marked a primary step into the spotlight
when
Farrakhan
defended
then-presidential
Jessie Jackson, accused of referring to New
York and Jews as Hymie-town and Hymies re-
spectively (although Jackson assured Farrakhan
that he had not uttered such). The emergence of
antisemitism within the Black radical tradition is
one of the saddest occurrences, and little ex-
planation of it is made in this text (indeed, it has

to my mind never been
given a satisfactory ex-
planation and I wonder
whether it can really be
as simple as a competi-
tion for principle perse-
cuted minority status in
America).

Gibson deals with the
subject
frankly
and
without apology, noting
Farrakhan’s
“deep
dis-
trust of Jews and a be-
lief that their support
for civil rights was dir-
ectly tied to a larger goal
of
controlling
Black
leaders.” (99) In some
places however her de-
scriptions
could
be
aided by deeper contex-
tualisation and examina-
tion;
she
writes
that
Farrakhan
“appears
to
have attributed the NOI’s newfound acceptance
[during the early 1970s] as a result of the lesser
influence of Jewish Americans in civil rights or-
ganizations” (71), but as Marc Dollinger has
shown, the Jewish American establishment had
been anything but opposed to the NOI in earlier
times (it was only during the late 1960s that the
emerging rift between Black and Jewish causes
prompted a re-evaluation).
Unfortunately Gib-
son does not cite Dollinger, or attempt to as-
sess the validity of Farrakhan’s statement.

Indeed, this is a short book and one feels it could
have benefited from more in depth analysis of
the social forces that were operating and influ-
encing Farrakhan as he rose to prominence,
honed his doctrine, and then retreated to the
shadows. The centrepiece of the book, around
which it is structured, is the Million Man March
which he organised in 1995, and which represen-
ted the peak of his public presence. However,
this focus occludes some other interesting as-
pects.

One fact that is not mentioned is Farrakhan’s
support for the Black Hebrew Israelites who
emigrated to Israel in 1969; known as the Origin-
al Hebrew Israelite Nation or African Hebrew Is-
raelites,
this
group
maintained
an
illegal
presence for two decades, growing to number
many hundreds, and engaged a war of attrition
against the state, until their acceptance of each
other in the 1990s. To Israel’s dismay, they wel-
comed Farrakhan on an unlikely (and undercover)
visit to Israel in 1978, and he took up their cause
in 1984 when Israeli determination to end the
stalemate led to renewed persecution. Their
leader Ben Ammi shared a stage with Farrakhan
when he spoke at the Million Man March.

All criticisms aside, Farrakhan has done much to
help Black Americans, and his persistence paid
off as the NOI’s work in communities and prisons
garnered much respect. Farrakhan as a vocal and
powerful advocate for Black America, and critic
of the establishment, should not be dismissed
based on his bigotry. Gibson’s book is an import-
ant contribution to our understanding of the
man, and deserves a place on every scholar’s
shelf.

NEOLIBERAL
RELIGION:
FAITH AND POWER IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CEN-
TURY. BLOOMSBURY. 203 PP. PBK £22.99.
ISBN: 978-1-350-11638-2.

Matthew Guest’s ‘Introduction’ to this timely
volume includes a definition of neoliberalism as
the “elevation of the sovereign individual” (p. 2),
that is an individual that seeks freedom from all
bonds of cultural, social or indeed religious re-
straint in order to pursue her or his (rational) in-

terests. While these interests remain bound
within the law, according to Guest, the Covid
pandemic illustrated that in the UK, many re-
garded the observation of restrictions on their
movement as an unbearable if not indeed tyran-
nical burden, despite the fact that disciplined
social distancing was, in the absence of a vac-
cine, the only effective circuit breaker to mass
infection. According to Guest, the pandemic “ex-
posed the embeddedness of neoliberal assump-
tions” in society (p. 3), namely the willingness of
individuals to prioritise their own private self-in-
terest over those of wider publics. For Guest,
the ubiquity and perniciousness of said “neolib-
eral assumptions” demands three moves: firstly
a “rethink of how the sociology of religion is con-
ceived”, secondly “concerted engagement with
other disciplines” and thirdly, a “jettisoning of
strict notions of ethical neutrality” (p. 4). I would
suggest that it is Guest’s discussion the last of
these that is of most interest and importance
and I highlight it here partly because it has been
omitted from some previous reviews of the
book.

The sociology of religion has, since its inception,
been dominated by the concept of modernity
and the assumption that modernity’s ever-ex-
panding and disenchanting energies, signal the
eclipse of religion. In the second half of the
twentieth century this assumption coalesced
into the secularization thesis which has domin-
ated the field ever since. Arguably, a more inter-
disciplinary sociology of religion is now emerging
from the shadow of the secularization hypo-
thesis which for Guest means rethinking the
field “through the neoliberal lens” (p. 15). This
lens focuses attention upon the “affinity” (ibid)
between diverse forms of religion from Pente-
costalism to New Age religions of the Self with
neoliberalism, generating “an argument about
the expansion of cultural affinities between cer-
tain kinds of thinking and social organization and
certain forms of religion” (p. 20) (I might take is-
sue with the term “affinities” which seems to
assume the attraction of essences or intrinsic
qualities to each other. A more appropriate term
could be “articulation” which means “any prac-
tice establishing a relation among elements
such that their identity is modified as a result of
the articulatory practice” [Laclau and Mouffe
1985: 105]).


## Page 25

The book proceeds with a series of chapters in
which Guest skilfully navigates, on behalf of his
reader, literatures addressing religion and mar-
kets, religion, populism and nationalism, religion
and the power-knowledge nexus in the post-
truth era, religion, securitization and the state,
religion and the self, religion and difference and
neoliberalism, the secular and non-religion. As
such, Guest argues that five “cultural forces” are
driving the articulation of religion and neoliberal-
ism, specifically (i) “marketization” which “draws
religious movements into
the logic of commercial
markets”,
(ii)
“populism”,
which
“reshapes
oppor-
tunities for political en-
gagement”,
(iii)
“destabilization of know-
ledge”
which
“exposes
new ways in which reli-
gious innovations become
plausible and visible in the
public
realm”,
(iv)
“pat-
terns
of
securitization”
which “reveal how religion
becomes a target of state
regulation”
and
(v)
“heightened individualism”
which
“converges
with
marketization to produce
market orientations to re-
ligious selfhood” (p. 166).
Importantly,
given
that
woven
throughout
are
paradigmatic
cases
of
economic exploitation, ra-
cial prejudice and the stigmatization of com-
munities, Guest is right to argue that the
sociology of religion’s “neoliberal lens” must, at
the same time, be an ethical one (p. 167). If
Hayek argued that liberal values were best em-
bedded by allowing markets to establish their
own equilibrium without interference from the
state, neoliberal experiments in places as di-
verse as Chile (1973) and Russia (following the
fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s) suggest
that the political conditions most conducive to
neoliberal capitalism are not liberal democracy
but authoritarianism if not indeed fascism. Ac-
cording to Guest, “the tendency to treat market
forces as best unhindered by moral discourse
means there is a logic within neoliberalism that

resists moral conversation”, which “is why that
conversation is especially important” (p. 169).

As Guest makes clear, the sociology of religion is
no stranger to ethical and moral debates, but
sociological research into religion has typically
been pursued according to arguments about
“methodological
atheism”
(p.
172)
and
the
dangers of subjective bias. The whole argument
about separating facts from values is, however,
questionable. Guest finds useful alternatives in

the critical sociology of
the Frankfurt School and
feminist theory, both of
which
have
long
distin-
guished
between
tradi-
tional theory which, under
the guise of objectivity
has tended to affirm the
existing
structures
and
norms of society and crit-
ical theory, which is expli-
citly
guided
by
values
which
propose the pro-
gressive
transformation
of society (pp. 176-8). Yet
even
as
he
notes
the
complex
institutional
structures
(“the
uni-
versity”) within which so-
ciologists of religion are
enmeshed and the differ-
ing layers of responsibility
and
accountability
that
the
pursuit
of research
generates to co-research-
ers and communities, to peers and colleagues
and to institutions, Guest seems so struggle
somewhat under the weight of his own under-
taking, rather blandly concluding that “ethical
questions are likely to be even more unavoidable
for the sociology of religion in the future” (p.
182).
Notwithstanding,
this
is
a
significant
volume and Matthew Guest should be praised
for his thoughtful navigation of a series of com-
plex, inter-disciplinary debates, and for his at-
tempt to push the sociology of religion into a
new direction.

HARRISON, P (ED). (2018) SETTING OUT ON
THE GREAT WAY, ESSAYS ON EARLY MAHAY-
ANA BUDDHISM. EQUINOX PUBLISHING. 320
PP. HBK £75. ISBN: 978 1 78179 096 0.

This review must begin with an abject and sin-
cere apology for being so very late, but even now
I would like to make modest comment on this
complex and in many ways challenging publica-
tion. I understand that it can still be acquired,
and librarians with an area for Buddhist studies
are positively encouraged to find space for a
hard copy. By way of excuse for lateness, I plead
reflection on the general elasticity of time, espe-
cially when it comes to Mahāyāna Buddhism.
What, after all, are a few fragile human years
against the backdrop of even just one kalpa, or
the incalculable lifespan of a tathāgata?

Indeed, when was the Mahāyāna itself set in mo-
tion? The contributions to this work range over
two or three centuries. And what was set in mo-
tion, a distinctive teaching, a spiritual impulse, a
modified form of monastic discipline? Or do we
regard as the main characteristic a flowering of
mythology and cosmology going far beyond that
characteristic of earlier phases of Buddhism?
The phrase “setting out” does imply the agency
of those who first proposed or initiated the
“great vehicle” (the Mahāyāna), and that they
set out on a new path, or a greater path, or at
least a newly conceived version of the original
path. But who were they, and what exactly did
they propose? The contributors to Setting out on
the Great Way are evidently conscious that they
and others have been working on the matter for
a long time, and yet the field investigated still
seems to be quite untidy. For example, the editor
Paul Harrison himself signals a notable diver-
gence over the so-called “forest hypothesis”
which is now critically reviewed by fellow con-
tributor David Drewes and noted as being quite
absent from a sutra from Gandhāra studied by
Otto Strauch (see below).

The underlying question is how did the earlier
phases of Buddhism come to morph into that
great religio-cultural flowering known as the
Mahāyāna?
For it surely did, and it is counter-
productive to complain of the evils of essential-
ism (as on page 23) if that means that coher-

ence is denied altogether. This does seem to be
the drift of Paul Harrison’s introduction, where
we are already given the somewhat impatient
view (not further argued in detail) that the Lotus
Sutra is “unlikely to be an early Mahāyāna sutra
anyway” (p. 13)! Leaving aside precise questions
about what would count as “early” (The Perfec-
tion of Insight sutras admittedly have pride of
place, see studies elsewhere by Edward Conze
and Lewis Lancaster) such an attitude perhaps
explains why for more than a century no self-
confident Indologist has taken the trouble to
provide an up-to-date translation of the Lotus
Sutra, that is, since Kern’s pioneer English in Max
Müller's Sacred Books of the East, Vol XXI. This
appeared in 1884 (following Burnouf’s posthum-
ous French version of 1852) – with some rather
wild footnotes about solar mythology. In the
meantime, students using English have made do
for decades with various competing translations
from Kumarajīva’s Chinese (with its different or-
dering of chapters), worthwhile though these
may be in themselves. But there is no doubt that
“the Lotus” was a relatively early Mahāyāna
composition, or compilation. If some parts are
later than others, then some parts are, after all,
earlier.

It comes as something of a relief to read in the
second
contribution
to
this
volume,
Peter
Skilling’s “How the Unborn was Born - The Riddle
of Mahayana Origins” that the Mahāyāna can be
briefly characterised under two points, namely
advocacy of the bodhisattva path as the way to
Buddhahood, and the idea that “all dharmas are
unborn and unceasing” (p.34). The second of
these points is summed up as meaning that
dharmas (i.e. all the analysable factors of exist-
ence) are without substance (one might gloss
as “persistent substance”) or own-being (pre-
sumably rendering svabhāva). While this corres-
ponds approximately to the already current
ideas of impermanence and non-self, it is taken
up into the idea that dharmas are “empty” (of
substantial being) and therefore cannot be per-
ceived or grasped. I would further explain that to
understand this is to let go of them and thereby
to be released. Skilling suspects that these two
points cannot be separated, and indeed he is
right, for this is, as a spiritual process, the very
path of the bodhisattva (or bodhisatva, as he


## Page 27

learnedly prefers to spell it, see his footnote 1),
who is then devoted to freeing others from their
entanglements. So perhaps there is a kind of
“essence” to the Mahāyāna after all,
even
though this term has recently become so unpop-
ular. In what may seem to some to be a slight
jump, Skilling sees the further elaboration of this
path, indeed the very task of a bodhisattva, as
being summed up in a widely commended “con-
cern for the preservation of the three jewels,” a
theme found in a variety
of texts, and certainly
popular
in
Theravada
lands.
There
are
long
quotations
about
this
with Sanskrit and Tibetan
in the footnotes. In con-
clusion
we
learn
from
Skilling
that
the
Mahāyāna was “born as a
congeries of pragmatic,
liturgical, and metaphys-
ical
innovations
in
re-
sponse to the centuries
of change that followed
Śākyamuni’s
great
de-
cease.” (p.53) This may
be true enough, and yet
one misses the connec-
tion
back
to
the
two
leading points set forth
at the outset; rather we
now learn, for example,
that the Mahāyāna is “a
path of merit and a path of protection” (p.54),
also a view current in Theravada lands, and in-
deed that the Mahāyāna is needed to “come to
the rescue” in this insecure world (p.55), and so
forth.

The theme of a multifaceted development is
taken up approvingly by Johannes Bronkhorst
who sets out its main exponents beginning with
the work of Gregory Schopen in a helpful manner.
The current trend, for also espoused by Harrison,
Shimoda and Boucher in this volume, is to argue
that the origin of the Mahāyāna is not to be
found in one single element. Bronkhorst’s main
concern however is to highlight the emergence
of a particular theme current in Greater Gand-
hāra, namely to the effect that the dharmas

commonly listed in Buddhist texts were them-
selves alone the locus of reality, rather than any
more complex entities deriving from them. This
then became the backdrop for the further as-
sertion that even the last-analysis dharmas do
not exist but are empty (of own-being). This
does not necessarily explain the provenance of
all aspects of the Mahāyāna, the bodhisattva
ideal for example being another matter, but it
does suggest a specific locus for one leading

feature, says Bronkhorst.
He refers to this develop-
ment as an “intellectual re-
volution”
(and
indeed
abhidharma is often cat-
egorised as an intellectual
matter),
but
it
might
equally be regarded as a
spiritual shift (see further
below).

With reference to Gand-
hāra the question of geo-
graphical
divergence
is
raised, and with it social
rather than intellectual di-
vergence. This seems to
have provided the underly-
ing
tension
for the
so-
called “forest hypothesis”,
previously
advanced
by
Harrison and others. The
attraction
of
this
hypo-
thesis,
i.e.
that
the
Mahāyāna was developed by spiritual adepts
who had withdrawn from society, is supposed to
have lain in a certain tiredness with an appar-
ently increasing focus on lay devotees. It is in
this sense a social theory; but unfortunately, it
is one which lacks any substantial sociological
basis and (naturally) is no longer accessible for
fieldwork. In the contribution by David Drewes
entitled “The Forest Hypothesis” it is also criti-
cised for other reasons. In particular, he argues
that it was unduly influenced by assumptions
about the importance of attainment of enlight-
enment in this life spread by Suzuki Daisetsu,
who himself is said to have over-corrected the
older Anglo-German idea that Buddhism as set
out in the Pali Canon was a more or less rational
matter. Although Suzuki was pursuing and pro-

![Image on page 27]


## Page 28

moting his own agenda, it may be commented in
passing that the idea of “attaining Buddhahood
[i.e. enlightenment] in this very life” (sokushin
jōbutsu) in fact has a substantial pedigree in Ja-
panese Buddhism. Note also that while Harrison,
in his introduction, seems to be reluctantly with-
drawing from the “forest hypothesis” he also
holds out the prospect of a further critical exam-
ination of the arguments adduced.

There is rather more sympathy for the signific-
ance of the presumed “forest monks” in Daniel
Boucher’s “Recruitment and Retention in early
Buddhist Sodalities” in which the idea of a single
hypothesis of origin for the Mahāyāna is again
rejected. Boucher draws analogies from the vari-
ous strains and tensions exhibited by the pion-
eers of modern-day new religious movements to
seek hints as to why new texts were pushed for-
ward by a variety of new groups that, taken to-
gether, came to be regarded as the Mahāyāna.
Fascinating though such speculation is, it unfor-
tunately remains in the realm of speculation due
to our inability to access any substantial evid-
ence from a social field. The argument is best
taken as a healthy reminder that new texts, with
shifts of vocabulary and thought, were indeed
produced by real persons, even if their identity,
not least thanks to the very nature of the “thus I
have heard” sutra genre, is lost from view. In this
respect the innovators were in any case very dif-
ferent from any modern counterparts in new reli-
gious
movements,
who
usually
cherish
a
personality cult.

Similar hints from phenomena nearer to our own
times are offered by Douglas Osto in “Altered
States and the Origins of the Mahayana”. The
point is argued in persuasive detail and indeed it
was
surely
the
case
that
at
least
some
Mahāyāna texts corresponded to “visions” or
“trance-like states” which could be reiterated
precisely with the help of the texts in question,
and in at least some of which a marvellous
samādhi is imaginatively set forth, opening up a
vision of new worlds, or in new-speak, multi-
verses. His exploration is reminiscent of, but ap-
parently not dependent on discussions of this
subject current in the late nineteen-sixties. Full
marks to Osto for mentioning the Lotus Sutra in
this regard. He might have gone on to discuss
the very genre of “visualisation” sutras, but of
course these were later, and Sanskrit originals

are mainly unknown. Both Boucher and Osto, in
their own ways, are addressing what I used to
call “the psychology of sutra production” and
this is surely an aspect worthy to be carefully re-
flected upon, and indeed suggestively treated in
these papers. But clues to the processes may
be found above all in the texts themselves. I
would here merely suggest that the psychology
of Buddhist sutra production (focused on the
phrase “thus I have heard”) is rather different
from that of the production of “holy scriptures”
or “bibles” as in the American Church of the Lat-
ter Day Saints (Mormons) or in some of the new
religions of Japan such as Tenshō Kōtai Jingū
Kyō.

In Sasaki Shizuka’s contribution, “The Concept
of ‘Remodelling the World’” similar considera-
tions are hovering in the background, without
becoming explicit. He focuses on the appear-
ance
of the
fascinating
Buddha
known
as
, whose deeds, vows and visions are
set forth in a sutra regarded as being very early,
even
pre-dating
the
. Be that as it may, it is of primary
significance as an early example of the way in
which the early Mahāyāna imagination worked.
Subliminally, the parallel with the sutras con-
cerning Amitābha will not fail to make itself felt.
The paradoxical effect of the

coming into prominence,
particularly through the work of Satō Naomi, is
on the one hand to relativise the high visibility of
the Amida texts of Pure Land Buddhism, and on
the other hand to increase the venerable ap-
pearance of such texts in general in the early
development of the Mahāyāna. That makes it
easier for Amida Buddhists to argue that their
key writings are typical of original Mahāyāna
(even if not demonstrably the very earliest) and
thereby even true to original Buddhism (as
Mahāyāna is presumed by Pure Land followers to
be). It should be noted that Sasaki is not actually
arguing this; but what can be drawn from his
presentation is that the imaginative invention of
further “worlds” as in the case of

was a persistent element in the ori-
ginal Mahāyāna mix. A consideration of empti-
ness alone is not enough.

Nevertheless, the notion of emptiness is per-
sistent, and we have already seen that Jo-
hannes
Bronkhorst
seeks
to
work
out
its


## Page 29

provenance. It would have been helpful if his
contribution had been directly followed by that
of Ingo Strauch on “Early Mahāyāna in Gandhāra:
New Evidence from the Bajaur Mahāyāna Sūtra”
a text which the author had previously studied in
detail (see his bibliography). Strauch checks this
text with respect to a number of leading ideas
commonly
reckoned
to
characterize
the
Mahāyāna, some of which are in evidence here,
while others are not. Of particular importance in
the text are the notion, and the articulation, of
the bodhisattva path. In this path is emphasised
a meditational feature described as “non-apper-
ception” but while the notion of emptiness is ap-
parently hovering in the background it is rarely
mentioned as a term. The plurality of buddha-
fields is regarded as “a foundational idea”, and
one of these is none other than Abhirati, the
world of
mentioned above. Amitābha
and his “pure land” however are notably absent.
Above all it is remarkable that there are no refer-
ences to prajñāpāramitā, the perfection of in-
sight
(or wisdom). This
absence
does
not
necessarily
imply
a
marked
difference
of
thought, for Strauch sums up the approach of
his text as a kind of “rhetoric of negation”, typic-
al of what might be termed the emptiness tradi-
tion.

Finally, we turn to the presentation by Rhi Juhy-
ung entitled “Looking for Mahāyāna Bodhisat-
tvas: A Reflection on Visual Evidence in Early
Indian Buddhism” which is accompanied by fig-
ures of Buddhist statuary, some waring turbans.
While the paper is learned, informative and inter-
esting, it does not really add any crucial clues to
the so-called “riddle” of Mahāyāna origins. Not
that this is any fault of the author. Rather, if we
follow carefully the variations introduced, the
statuary seems to have lagged behind the texts
and the meditations and visions which inspired
it. In this perspective it is appropriate that Rhi’s
account appears at the end, together with some
welcome illustrations of bodhisattva figures
from Gandhāra. Though evidently hard to identi-
fy, these do show at least that Mahāyāna devo-
tion was turning towards such figures as well as
to the Buddha himself, thus intimating ever
greater complexity.

Reflecting partly divergent views presented at a
conference, this book does not quite get to

have a common program. Though parts may be
read with much profit, there is evidently still no
clear consensus about when, where and how the
Great Vehicle came to be set in motion. There is
also no clear consensus about methodology. Of
course, Indologists will always salute philological
work, and that is fine as far as it goes, though
some readers may find the number and com-
plexity of footnotes rather tedious (sometimes
with lengthy and potentially anachronistic quo-
tations from Tibetan). Insofar as Mahāyāna is re-
garded as having been somehow “new” then
analogies from more recent examples of innova-
tion in religion are not inappropriate. But the
problem is an old one, and in some ways a gener-
al one. After all, when, where, and how did
Gnosticism, the Renaissance, the Reformation,
Tantra or neo-Shamanism get going? How do
streams of tradition and clumps or clusters of
innovation need to be analysed, defined and as-
sessed? If the search for a single “essence” is
chimeric, how many characteristics make up an
apple, or a pear, or an onion, and which ones?

MCINTYRE, E. (2018) RELIGIOUS HUMOR IN
EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN AND MORMON CUL-
TURE. BLOOMSBURY ACADEMIC. 221 PP. HBK
£108. ISBN: 978-1-3500-0548-8.

This entertaining book is delightful to read and
yet
academically
excellent.
Elisha
McIntyre
opens with a joke – “Who was the greatest
comedian in the Bible? Samson. He brought the
house down” (p. 3) – and builds a fascinating ar-
gument about the way humour is deployed in
conservative religious cultures. Humour is po-
tentially anarchic and offensive, especially hu-
mour that deals with the sacred and religion.
McIntyre’s interest is in religious humour, not hu-
mour about religion; that is, it is intended to be
experienced and enjoyed by people in the faith
community. Chapter 1, “Evangelicals, Mormons,
and Popular Culture,” traces how evangelical
Christians and Mormons participate in popular
culture. The “Mollywood” film industry makes ap-
propriate films for Mormons, most often ro-
mantic comedies in which drinking coffee (let


## Page 30

alone alcohol) and hand holding (let alone kiss-
ing) are not permitted, yet couples come togeth-
er in ways that charm the Mormon audience and
respect its faith. The second chapter, “Introdu-
cing the Challenges of Humor,” acknowledges
that the type of humour that Mormons and
Christians find acceptable is severely restricted,
and appropriate humour must be clean. Later
McIntyre notes that humour in faith contexts
has humility at its core.

McIntyre
admires
the
evangelical
comedian
Chonda Pierce, who “in-
fuses her entire shows
with her Christianity” (p.
87), while still being able
to discuss female sexual
states such as meno-
pause and body image
(which inspires her hilari-
ous
riff
on
Spanx,
or
“shapeware,”
the
con-
trolling
undergarments
that middle-aged women
have recourse to in order
to reinstate their waists
and a more youthfully at-
tractive female shape).
McIntyre
argues
that
such jokes avoid blas-
phemy
and
promote
faith. Chapter 4, “Appro-
priate Humor II: Clean and
Dirty
Humor,”
explains
that obscenity, foul lan-
guage, and vulgarity are
explicitly prohibited from humour that promotes
faith and amuses the faithful. These ideas of
clean and dirty humour are built upon ideas of
the body either as pure or as polluted. So
“swearing, toilet humor, and sexual humor” (p.
97) are not allowed in faith communities, and the
importance of not corrupting children is sig-
nalled by the use of the term “family-friendly” (p.
99), which holds to strict boundaries. Clean
sexual humour refers only to marriage but can be
controversial. Thor Ramsay’s routine concerning
he and his wife experiencing IVF to have children
is quite explicit in certain ways, yet acknow-
ledges God’s contribution to his family unam-
biguously.

The next chapter, “Appropriate Humour III: Safe
and Subversive Humor,” notes the distaste for
humour “based solely on attacking and insulting
others” (p. 135). Christian and Mormon humour
is likely to be non-hostile and non-subversive.
McIntyre analyses the evangelical sitcom Pastor
Greg in detail, and discusses comedians includ-
ing Thor Ramsey, Brad Stines, and Chonda Pierce
as purveyors of riskier, critical comedy that
could be perceived as hostile on occasion.
Stones, in particular, practices aggressive com-
edy. He says “as a Christian, I am not allowed to

hate people, but I’m com-
manded to hate ideas that
are different than God’s”
(p.
159).
The
Mormon
magazine Sunstone is an-
other example of subvers-
ive humour; well-known for
“witty cartoons alongside
…[and]
penetrating
art-
icles of social comment-
ary”
(p.163).
The
illustrations are very amus-
ing, and a range of Sun-
stone
cartoons
are
included. The "Conclusion”
reiterates the evangelical
and
Mormon
comedians’
claim that popular culture
can entertain acceptably,
as long as it is not offens-
ive
to
religion.
McIntyre
notes
how
religious
comedians negotiate the
boundaries of taste in their
communities, and how they keep the goal of
honouring God front and centre.

The study of religion and humour is a small sub-
field and there are many opportunities for it to
expand. McIntyre’s book is unique, as most
studies treat comedy and comedians outside
religion(s) making jokes about religion. Here the
focus on insiders, theological humour, and the
production of comedy (films, stand up, cartoons,
and jokes) that the scholarly audience is likely to
be entirely unfamiliar with is refreshing, enter-
taining, and informative. This book is highly re-
commended.

READER, I. (2024) RELIGION AND TOURISM IN
JAPAN:
INTERSECTIONS,
IMAGES,
POLICIES
AND PROBLEMS. BLOOMSBURY. 257 + XI PP.
HBK £85. ISBN: 978-1-3504-1883-7.

Ian Reader has produced a well documented and
tightly argued book that shows, as the author
sets out to do, that, within the broad remit of
secularism’s grasp, tourism has meant that reli-
gious sites, especially pilgrimage trails, have be-
come
dominated
by
leisure
and
heritage
disourses that crowds
out
their
“religious”
significance within Ja-
pan. If critical readers
worry that these terms
do not “properly” apply
to Japan, Reader fully
justifies his utilisation
of
them
in
his
first
chapter giving a local
and
indigenous
con-
text, relating his work
to critical studies on
the concept of “reli-
gion” in Japan.

The book consists of
six main chapters as
well as a substantial
introduction and con-
clusion (or chapter 7).
The introduction starts
with a vivid description
of how a “religious” site
is contrasted with a “tourist” site by a bus driver
taking visitors to what he seemed to regard as
something which should be the former but has
become regarded as the latter. It also opens up
many of the terms and issues that arise in later
chapters, with particular chapters, while focused
on differing case studies, also taking on specific
issues. Chapter one takes on definitions of the
two key terms “religion” and “tourism”, which in-
cludes both a critical discussion of the wider dis-
ciplinary fields, as well as the local context
regarding what they mean in Japan. Reader
makes a key point which is that often scholars of
tourism operate with uncritical definitions of “re-
ligion”, but equally religious studies scholars are
naïve in how they conceptualise “tourism”. He
also, rightly, takes issue with any conception

that these two are opposites and must be en-
visaged within a zero sum game mentality. He
demonstrates that aspects of what we may
term “tourism” has roots within Japanese his-
tory both as a term and a concept, with a long
association with many pilgrimage trails and
sites. One note that may be raised here for read-
ers of the book, is that there is a lot of repetition
of themes, issues, and arguments between the
chapters. This, for myself, was somewhat tedi-
ous, and went beyond simple reminders. Never-

theless, I do not raise it as a
critique because Reader may
well be alert to the fact that
some readers will only read
one or two chapters; many
chapters
would
be
ideal
class readings. His approach
helps include in each chapter
critical issues on termino-
logy, the political
context,
and the Japanese historical
context
around
these
is-
sues.

Chapter two then addresses
the development of trans-
port networks – often at first
bus tours, later railways, but
also considering the rise of
car ownership – alongside
state
policies
on
tourism.
Chapter three then specific-
ally takes on the status of
secularism
within
Japan’s
constitution, and so how “religious” sites (often
officially registered as such) can be promoted
and supported by the state by framing them as
part of “culture” or “heritage”. Chapters four to
six take on particular locations as case studies,
but also set them in the context of specific is-
sues, though these often overlap and intersect.
Chapter four on the Shikoku pilgrimage looks at
how representations in popular television and
media affect the image and popularity of sites.
The next chapter takes another pilgrimage trail,
Saikoku, and shows how railway companies
helped popularise it and how, in particular, the
question of food, especially sweets, became as-
sociated with the temples and shrines. The sixth
chapter then takes on the tradition of Shugendo
and its association with particular mountain re-

![Image on page 31]


## Page 32

gions, showing how practitioners both resist and
encourage the more touristic elements, and
what this means for tradition. As mentioned
above, many issues recur across these chapters
as issues typically affect the sites in general,
which has the benefit of allowing chapters to be
employed as class readings in that most of the
core issues will be included in any chapter, but
does add to a sense of déjà vu for a reader of
the whole book. Notably, the focus in the case
studies is not so much the sites themselves,
though their history and development is well de-
scribed, but the wider issues that concern the
book’s argument.

Chapter 7, or the “Concluding comments” which
are a full chapter length, bring together the argu-
ments and issues in the book. Key in this is that
religious institutions have often acted from a
position of weakness in the modern period,
needing both visitors and money, and so they
actively cooperate in what we may term the
commoditisation of their temples, shrines, and
pilgrimage sites. Unease with this is balanced
against pragmatism. As noted above, Reader
resists the religion-versus-tourism binary, rightly
noting how what we may term leisure and com-
mercialism was in place in pre-modern Japan.
But he also shows why, especially over the last
few decades, we see something quite radically
new in how this is managed. The author also
shows how the heritage and culture discourse,
including sites becoming UNESCO world herit-
age sites or recognised as significant in Japan,
feeds into a change in how these sites are un-
derstood and need to operate. The way that gov-
ernment is integrated into this, with tourism
being a key government policy for many rural
areas, where these sites are often located, must
frame the “heritage” angle above “religion” as
the state cannot be involved with the latter.
There is a Japanese dynamic, but one which is
not unique to that context. Some other argu-
ments also arise within his discussion and con-
clusion, but I raise these as some of my major
takeaways in a rich discussion.

In conclusion, Reader offers an important contri-
bution not simply to the study of religion in Ja-
pan, but also to studies on religion and tourism,
and wider arguments around how religion is com-

modified and repackaged in the contemporary
secular, social media saturated, and capitalist
landscape. Insights beyond the Japanese con-
text, though these are not Reader’s concern,
certainly will
strike
thoughtful
interlocutors
grappling with this book. It is another sign also
that Bloomsbury is a place where a lot of the
most interesting scholarship in religious studies
is emerging. Every serious library in the study of
religion, and especially in religion and tourism
(and popular culture) should include this book.

ATHEISM
IN
FIVE
MINUTES. EQUINOX PUBLISHING. 280 PP. HBK
£70. ISBN: 9781800502369.

is a collection of short
essays edited by Teemu Taira. It is a concise yet
comprehensive exploration of atheism. The book
provides readers with an understanding of what
atheism is and is not and its implications for so-
ciety and individuals. It is a thought-provoking
and accessible introduction to atheism, making
it ideal for newcomers and those seeking to
deepen their understanding.

The book is structured straightforwardly, each
chapter focusing on a specific aspect of athe-
ism. A leading scholar writes each of the sixty-
four chapters, drawing on the latest research.
They offer concise and thoughtful answers
along with suggestions for further reading. The
book is ideal for classroom use and personal
study. Some of the questions the book asks in-
clude: Are children born atheists? (pp.185-188).
Do atheists have rituals? (pp.224-226). Are
atheists immoral? (pp.231-234). How has athe-
ism related to politics? (pp.117-120). Why do
some atheists remain members of religious
groups? (pp.156-159). Is it challenging to be an
atheist in Muslim countries? (pp.67-70). Do
atheist parents have atheist children? (pp.189-
192). Why are there so few black atheists?
(pp.109-112). Has the Internet made atheism


## Page 33

more popular? (pp.92-95). The authors skilfully
navigate through various philosophical
argu-
ments for and against the existence of God,
shedding light on the complexities of theological
discourse while maintaining a straightforward
approach. The book addresses common miscon-
ceptions and stereotypes surrounding atheism,
debunking myths and clarifying its moral and
ethical implications. It emphasises the compat-
ibility of atheism with values such as compas-
sion, empathy, and social justice, challenging the
notion that atheism necessarily leads to nihilism
or moral relativism.

One of the book's strengths
lies in its examination of the
diversity within atheism it-
self. The book delves into
different forms of atheism,
from secular humanism to
existential
atheism,
high-
lighting the nuanced differ-
ences in their approaches to
life's existential questions.
Through
this
exploration,
readers gain a deeper ap-
preciation for the richness
and complexity of atheist
thought. Another strength
of the book is its discussion
of atheism's relationship to
religion.
Paul-Francois
Tr-
emlett
acknowledges
the
complex interplay between
atheism and religious belief,
noting that atheism can ex-
ist alongside various religious traditions and that
not all atheists are hostile to religion (pp.79-82).
The book examines the role of atheism in secu-
larism and the separation of church and state,
arguing that atheism can provide a valuable per-
spective in promoting religious freedom and
equality. Throughout the book, contributors en-
gage with critical philosophical and ethical ques-
tions that atheism raises. They address the
challenge of morality without religion, arguing
that moral principles can be grounded in human
reason and empathy rather than divine com-
mand. The book also explores the implications of
atheism for concepts such as meaning and pur-

pose in life, suggesting that atheism can offer a
sense of freedom and responsibility to create
meaning for oneself.

In addition to its intellectual exploration of athe-
ism, the book also touches on its practical im-
plications
for
individuals
and
society.
Ryan
Cragun and Peter Klug discuss the stigma often
faced by atheists, particularly in religiously con-
servative societies, and the importance of pro-
moting
tolerance
and
understanding
(pp.148-155). They also consider the role of
atheism in contemporary debates on science,
education, and public policy, highlighting the

need for evidence-based
decision-making and crit-
ical thinking.

Despite its brevity, Athe-
ism in Five Minutes is a
rich and thought-provok-
ing read that covers sev-
eral topics with clarity and
insight.
Contributors
do
not
shy away from
ad-
dressing challenging philo-
sophical issues, including
topics such as the prob-
lem of evil, the nature of
consciousness,
and
the
meaning of life with intel-
lectual rigour, encouraging
readers to reflect critically
on their beliefs and as-
sumptions. The book is ac-
cessible
and
engaging,
making complex ideas accessible to readers of
all backgrounds.

While the contributors acknowledge the global
diversity of religious belief, the book focuses
primarily on atheism in Western societies. A
more extensive exploration of atheism in other
cultural and religious contexts would have en-
riched the book's analysis and provided a more
comprehensive understanding of atheism as a
global phenomenon.

In conclusion, Atheism in Five Minutes is highly
recommended for anyone interested in exploring

the concepts of atheism and secularism. The
contributors' clear and concise writing styles
and insightful analysis make this book an invalu-
able resource for understanding the complexit-
ies of atheism and its implications for individuals
and society. Whether one is a sceptic, a believer,
or somewhere in between, Atheism in Five

Minutes offers a compelling insight into a topic
that continues to spark debate and inquiry in the
modern world.
