# Hong Kong Government Information - Fire Safety & Scaffolding

**Generated:** 2025-11-27 14:08:54  
**Total Pages Collected:** 5  

## Research Context

This research was conducted in response to the **tragic Tai Po fire on November 26, 2025**, 
where bamboo scaffolding covered with highly flammable materials (styrofoam, non-compliant 
mesh netting) contributed to rapid fire spread, resulting in **44 deaths** and becoming 
Hong Kong's deadliest building fire.

## Research Focus

1. **Bamboo Scaffolding Policies** - Government plans for phasing out bamboo scaffolding
2. **Fire Safety Regulations** - Building and construction site fire safety standards
3. **Previous Fire Incidents** - How government handled similar fire incidents
4. **Building Renovation Safety** - Standards for external maintenance and renovation work

## Key Questions

- What are the current regulations for bamboo scaffolding in Hong Kong?
- Are there any plans to phase out bamboo scaffolding?
- What fire safety standards apply to scaffolding materials (mesh, wrapping)?
- How have previous major fires influenced building safety policies?
- What inspection requirements exist for ongoing renovation work?
