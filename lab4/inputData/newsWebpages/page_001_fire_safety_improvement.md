Fire Safety Improvement
Fire safety is one of the primary considerations in building designs. Some of the building components are designed to resist fire and to prevent spread of fire and protect people and their properties from the effect of fire. Adequate means of escape are also necessary in the event of fire and other emergencies.
Common Fire Safety Provisions Found in Buildings
Fire rated door
Fixed Light
Enclosures to Non-emergency Services
What should owners do?
Maintenance and Alteration of Fire Safety Provisions
Keep the fire safety provisions under proper maintenance. Unauthorised alterations to these fire safety provisions may reduce their fire resisting properties and thus the fire safety of the building.
See also: Unauthorised Alteration of Fire Resisting Construction in Buildings
Points to note during maintenance of building
If unauthorised alteration or defective fire resisting construction is found, the owner, the owner's corporation or the management company should enlist the service of an Authorized Person to:
Advise on the conditions
Propose improvement works
Apply for approval and consent for commencement of improvement works from the Building Authority as necessary
Fire Safety Improvement Works for Old Buildings
Old buildings do not meet all the current fire safety standards; therefore owners are expected to carry out basic or essential improvement works to provide better protection to the occupants in case of fire.
Check the following reference for details.
Examples of Basic and Essential Improvement Works
Receiving Fire Safety or Fire Safety Improvement Direction
Owners should, in their own interest, take the initiative to complete the required improvement works in their premises/buildings so as to comply with the Fire Safety Directions / Fire Safety Improvement Directions within the specified period, concerning:
Means of escape in case of fire,
Means of access for fire fighting and rescue,
Measures inhibiting the spread of fire and ensuring the structural integrity
Owners should:
Appoint an Authorized Person and/or Registered Structural Engineer and Registered Contractor to carry out the fire safety improvement works required under the Directions.

Notes
Notes
Exempted building works:Building professionals are recommended to be appointed.
Works required prior approval and consent from the Building Authority: Authorized Persons/ Registered Structural Engineer are required to be appointed.
Minor Works:Prescribed registered contractor and/or prescribed building professional are required to be appointed with respect to the relevant minor works item.
Should fire rated door be tested against BS or BS EN Standard? What are the acceptance criteria?
Both BS and BS EN Standards are acceptable. For a fire rated door, it should be accompanied by the supplier's statement and test report/and assessment report demonstrating that the door has been tested by an accredited laboratory and complies with the required standards.
In general, the installation of a fire rated door should meet the requirements below:
Solid timber construction or accord with the construction specified in the test report.
Firmly implanted to the surrounding walls without any visible gaps.
Provision of door closer.
Can a lock be installed at the fire rated doors?
Generally, it is not acceptable to install a locking device in a fire rated door across an exit of a building.
If it is necessary to secure an exit door against entry from outside, the locking device shall be of the type which is capable of being readily opened from the inside without the use of key, or if electrical lock is used, the lock should be released automatically at times of power failure.
Can the FS water tank be placed on the roof?
The building owner should consult an Authorized Person and/or Registered Structural Engineer with a view to assessing the structural adequacy of the affected existing structure including vetting of approved structural plans/details and on-site verification of the conditions of existing structural elements.
If building works including the strengthening of the existing structures are involved, a proposal for alteration and addition works should be submitted to BD for approval.
Upon Completion of the Fire Safety Improvement Works
Owners should:
notify the Fire Safety Section of the BD
provide copies of all certificates / test reports / assessment reports of the fire rated doors, fixed lights to the windows and fire rated enclosures to non-emergency services within the escape staircases.
BD will arrange and conduct compliance inspection as soon as possible.
How to handle the improvement works in the common parts of the building?
The co-owners of the building should arrange to carry out the works. If an Owners' Corporation (OC) has been formed under the Building Management Ordinance (BMO), the OC should arrange for the carrying out of the improvement works. Home Affairs Department would assist in formation of the OC under the BMO.
What if certain improvement works are not complied with due to site constraints?
The owner may contact the responsible BD officers to discuss possible alternatives to suit site conditions or need to appoint a consultant or an Authorized Person to propose alternative solutions.
The Buildings Department will adopt a flexible and pragmatic approach to enforce the Fire Safety Direction/ Fire Safety Improvement Direction.
Besides, the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) provides relevant guidance and advice to owners of domestic and composite buildings who have joined the rehabilitation schemes. For details of scheme, please refer to the URA's website: http://www.ura.org.hk/
What if the improvement works cannot be completed before the specified period?
The owners should apply in writing to the BD for an extension of time with supporting documents including:
owners' corporation meeting notes
tender documents
work schedule
tenancy agreement
evidence of work having started
temporary health problems, etc.
Alternative Solutions Adopting Flexible and Pragmatic Approach
Owners may have difficulties in carrying out fire safety improvement works in old buildings.
The Buildings Department is prepared to adopt a flexible and pragmatic approach on enforcing the Fire Safety Directions/ Fire Safety Improvement Directions.
Here are some cases highlighting the difficulties commonly encountered by the owners and the alternative solutions generally accepted by the Buildings Department.
Case 1 : Inadequate Space for Provision of Protected Lobby in Escape Staircase
Alternative solution:If there is genuine site constraint due to the approved layout, in lieu of a protected lobby with two fire rated doors, the Buildings Department will accept a compensatory provision of a single fire rated door with doubled fire rating period.
Tips for improving Fire Safety - Alternative Solutions : Protected Lobby (Chinese only)
Case 2 : Inadequate Headroom or Width after Installation of Enclosures to Non-emergency Services
Alternative solution:Localised projections with minimum resultant headroom of 1900mm and minimum resultant width of 750mm after installation of fire-rated enclosures to non-emergency services will be tolerated.

New owners of premises/building with Fire Safety Direction or Fire Safety Compliance Order not yet complied with
Under section 14B of the Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance, the new owner must notify the relevant enforcement authority (i.e. the Director of Buildings and/or the Director of Fire Services) in writing within 3 months upon completion of property transfer. To facilitate such notification, the new owner may complete a Notice of Transfer of Interests for submission to the Buildings Department.
A new owner who fails to submit a written notification is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $10,000.
What is Fire Safety Direction / Fire Safety Improvement Direction?
The Fire Safety Direction or Fire Safety Improvement Direction is issued to direct the owners to improve the fire safety standard of their premises/building in accordance with the fire safety construction measures under the Fire Safety (Commercial Premises) Ordinance, Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance and Fire Safety (Industrial Buildings) Ordinance within a specified period.
