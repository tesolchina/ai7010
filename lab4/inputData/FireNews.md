What we know so far:

44 people, including a firefighter, have died. Some 279 are still missing

68 people are in hospital, 16 in critical condition, 25 deemed serious

Full-scale rescue work is ongoing, with a woman and more pets evacuated from buildings

The eight residential blocks in the estate had been undergoing renovations since July 2024, sheathed in bamboo scaffolding and green mesh

Authorities say the rapid spread of fire was “unusual”, with styrofoam material found in buildings

Government has launched investigations, including criminal probes, to find cause of deadly blaze

Three people - two directors and a consultant of the contractor behind the renovation work - have been arrested for manslaughter

Police are searching premises of management firm running the housing estate

Blazes in four of the seven buildings were brought under control by early morning, after nearly 10 hours. Three more are still burning but flames have retreated to upper floors

Chief Executive John Lee has described the fire as a “massive catastrophe”

Death toll at 44 surpasses Garley building fire of 1996 where 41 perished

Electioneering activities have been suspended ahead of December 7 election

Lee says he will review need to postpone the election

Chief Executive John Lee has ordered inspections on all Hong public housing estates underoing major renovations as authorities launched a criminal investigation into the city’s deadliest fire at a Tai Po estate that has claimed 44 lives.

About 280 are still unaccounted for and rescue work has continued amid flames now retreating onto the upper floors of three of the residential blocks. As of 10am, 68 people are in hospital, with 16 in a critical condition. Twenty-five are deemed serious cases.

Raging flames at four out of the seven blocks in Wang Fuk Court have been brought under control while the three others still have fires on the upper floors of their 31-storey structures. Full-scale rescue work is ongoing and victims are still being extracted from the buildings.

According to a preliminary investigation, officers discovered highly flammable styrofoam cloaking lift windows on every floor, which authorities said caused the fire to spread more rapidly within the blocks and ignite flats through the corridors. The mesh netting and sheeting used outside the buildings also did not meet fire safety standards, officials said on Wednesday night.

Three people, including two directors and a consultant of the contractor responsible for the renovation of the buildings, have been arrested for manslaughter. They allegedly used non-compliant materials in scaffolding nets and sealed windows with styrofoam, which sparked the tragedy as the highly flammable substances caused the fire to spread rapidly.

President Xi Jinping expressed his condolences in a statement on Wednesday evening and called for “all-out efforts” to minimise casualties and losses. After visiting the injured in hospital early on Thursday, city leader John Lee Ka-chiu vowed to investigate the fire and the scaffolding.

The fire was first reported at 2.51pm on Wednesday and soon grew into an inferno, with huge plumes of dark smoke billowing high into the sky at the scene at Wang Fuk Court, and the flames quickly spreading to seven out of eight blocks in the estate.

Police said they received multiple reports of people trapped in the building where the blaze started, with a man and a woman reportedly unconscious and suffering from burns as being among the first victims.

The blaze was initially classified as a No 1 alarm fire but was quickly raised to No 4 by 3.34pm and then to the top-level No 5 at 6.22pm. In Hong Kong, fires are rated on a scale of one to five, with higher numbers indicating greater severity.

Initial footage from the scene showed bamboo scaffolding outside several flats of the building rapidly bursting into spiralling flames, before being completely engulfed in multiple towering columns of fire. Burning sections of green scaffolding mesh fell to the ground.

Shenzhen residents offer ‘anything you want, as long as it helps’
Dozens of online commenters in Shenzhen are asking why Hong Kong did not request the city’s state-of-the-art aerial ladder fire-fighting truck which can reach 101 metres (331 feet) – nearly twice its local counterparts.

One social media user, who was staying near Shenzhen’s Liantang checkpoint, said he was “very happy” when he saw fire engines queued there, but “disappointed” later to learn that Hong Kong did not ask for help from the mainland.

“Shenzhen has one new aerial ladder fire-fighting truck that can reach 101 metres which could surely have helped to tackle the fire or rescue people at higher floors,” he wrote.

“From the TV footage, I think Hong Kong ones reach about half that height. But I am not sure why it was not sent over to Hong Kong to join the fight, maybe not enough space for it to manoeuvre?”

According to mainland media reports, the Shenzhen fire-fighting truck referred to made its operational debut at a high-rise building fire last year. Costing about 24 million yuan (US$3.3 million), the vehicle can ascend to 80 metres in less than 10 minutes and can withstand winds up to level 6.

Several online Shenzhen residents expressed similar feelings, with one commenting that the city was willing to give its best equipment and firefighters. “We can see the smoke from Taipo’s fire from Shenzhen. We are worried too and we want to help. Feel free to use our ladder truck, drones, anything you want, as long as it helps.”

1:38PM
Citywide inspection of housing estate renovations under way
Chief Executive John Lee convened an inter-departmental meeting this morning and instructed immediate inspections of all housing estates across the city currently undergoing major maintenance work to ensure the safety of scaffolding and construction materials.

The city leader also stated in a social media post that his administration would provide financial help, temporary accommodation and other forms of support to those affected as soon as possible, and would follow up with the necessary relief arrangements.

MAMA Awards to go ahead, but with a subdued atmosphere: Korean media
The 2025 MAMA Awards will go ahead as scheduled at Kai Tak Sports Park, according to Korean media, but will take place “in a much more subdued and solemn atmosphere than originally planned.”

“We are taking the seriousness of the current fire situation in the Tai Po region of Hong Kong very seriously, and the MAMA AWARDS organising committee is rapidly discussing appropriate response measures for each category… We will share updates as soon as everything is finalized,” the organising committee said, as cited by Korean media.

Reports also note that several artists have already departed for Hong Kong, and that veteran Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-fat and Malaysian star Michelle Yeoh are scheduled to appear as presenters. It remains unclear whether there will be any changes to the arrangements.

Worried for their home
Kevin Ng, a Kwong Fuk Estate resident not affected by the fire, says he is worried about his home after not being able to go back and close the windows.

“I live at Kwong Yau House with my girlfriend and was rushing back home at 6.30pm but was told I cannot go back,” he said. “We do have a lot of clothes and electronic appliances placed on the balcony, so yes, I am worried.”

Ng, who works nearby at the Science Park, says he offered help at the estate platform to help distribute daily essentials to those in need until midnight, before heading to Tung Cheong Street Community Hall to spend the night.

“Of course, we couldn’t sleep at all,” the 22-year-old adds. “But there are so many helpful people donating things all night long, but initially it was quite chaotic from the beginning.”

1:18PM
Community collection points
Different communities across Hong Kong are collecting donations for families affected by the fire.

In Discovery Bay, residents are being asked to provide everything from blankets and sleeping mats to power banks, food and other basic essentials.

“Together, we can bring comfort, hope and relief to those in need. Thank you for your continued support, compassion and standing together as a community,” one organiser says.

HK$30 million from Jack Ma Foundation; Alibaba, Ant Group ready to help
The Jack Ma Foundation says in a statement on Thursday that it will commit HK$30 million (US$3.9 million) to provide support to the families impacted by the fire, as well as to the firefighters and rescue operations.

On behalf of the founder of Alibaba Group Holding and Ant Group Jack Ma, the foundation says it stands with everyone affected by the fire. Alibaba and Ant also say they are ready to offer their support.

Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.

No response at contractor company’s office
The Post visits the premises of Prestige Construction and Engineering Company in Laurels Industrial Centre in San Po Kong, Kowloon, and finds the shutters closed. There is no doorbell, only a facial recognition access device at the doorstep.

An employee working at the office next door says Prestige is usually open at this hour, but without many people entering or leaving the premises.

The Post also visits 14 Hing Yin Street, the registered address of Wong Hap-yin, a director and shareholder of Will Power Architects Company in To Kwa Wan, Kowloon. However, the address is inaccurate.

The Post knocks on the doors of 13 and 15 Hing Yin Street – connected on the fourth floor of the same building – as well as of 14 Hing Yan Street, but receives no answer.

A neighbour on an upper floor in the building on Hing Yan Street says some flats are used as subdivided homes and confirms that a “14 Hing Yin Street” does not exist.

A night on the streets
Exhausted residents, including those living in the nearby Kwong Fuk Estate, spent the night on the streets after being evacuated under police orders.

Sam Wong, a waiter in his thirties, and his girlfriend slept under the escalators in the estate mall on bedding handed out to them, which kept them warm overnight.

“We didn’t go to the shelters because it is too crowded, and we might be sent to another one if it’s too full. We want to stay closer to home as it feels safer and we could head back whenever the building is open again,” Wong said.

His girlfriend Joanne Li, a housewife in her forties, added, “If we can’t head back to the flat tonight, we will stay with some friends.”

Residents at risk of fire hazard helped with shelter and donations
On the third floor of Tung Cheong Street Community Hall where some fire hazard residents are staying, daily essentials including food, drinks, clothes, blankets and towels are stacked in paper boxes.

Some of the mattresses remain unoccupied and are labelled that they can be used. Meanwhile, the residents who are seeking shelter are picking what they need from the donated materials in an orderly manner.

A Post photographer also captures images of some citizens voluntarily bringing donated goods and leaving them for the affected residents to choose from.

Tourist from Shanghai brings flowers to site
Student Wei Huazhen, 20, who is visiting Hong Kong for a week, says he decided to go to the site of the fire after hearing the news on Wednesday.

“When I was little, there was a big fire in my hometown, Shanghai. This incident reminded me of that, and I wanted to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the deceased,” Wei says, referring to a blaze in a 28-storey building in Shanghai that claimed 58 people’s lives, and also involved scaffolding.

“I feel very sad standing here at this moment, thinking about all the people who were trapped and suffered.”

He travelled from Tsim Sha Tsui in the morning and bought flowers on his way to the site.

Blood donations surge
There has been a surge of social media appeals urging people to donate blood after the blaze.

At the Causeway Bay donor centre, all bookings for today are full, but people are still turning up to see if they can help.

“There is currently no severe shortage at the blood bank according to the Hospital Authority’s meeting this morning,” a medical staff member says, but adds that supplies must remain stable in the long term and the city cannot rely on one or two days of fully booked appointments.

Celebrities pray for safety, entertainment events adjusted
Many Hong Kong artists, including Nicholas Tse, Charmaine Sheh, Joey Yung, William Chan, and Gillian Chung, have posted messages such as “Wishing for safety” and “May everyone be safe” on social media.

Mainland Chinese stars have also expressed support, including Song Yuqi who worte, “Hope everyone will be safe,” while artists like Samantha Ko and Angie Chiu also shared similar messages.

According to Korean media, the 2025 MAMA Awards will continue as planned on November 28 and 29 at Kai Tak Sports Park, but the event will be toned down with a solemn atmosphere. Local stars such as Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-fat will not attend the ceremony.

The premiere of Zootopia 2, originally scheduled for November 27 at Hong Kong Disneyland, has been cancelled by the organisers.

Singer Jace Chan announced on social media that public ticket sales for her concert, originally set for November 27, will be postponed.

She wrote, “I feel deeply saddened by the serious fire in Tai Po. It’s probably not suitable to go ahead with ticket sales for the concert at this time, so we will postpone the public sale originally scheduled for this Friday. JACE WORLD will announce further updates. Sorry for any inconvenience. Wishing everyone safety.”

Support from tycoon Li Ka-shing
The Li Ka Shing Foundation, controlled by the city’s billionaire business magnate, has announced the launch of an emergency fund of HK$30 million to support registered charities, particularly those serving the Tai Po area, in providing immediate relief and longer-term help to the fire victims.

Registered charities can submit applications through the Tsz Shan Monastery website, which is due to be activated by 1pm on Thursday.

The foundation will also offer support to firefighters and first responders who are killed or injured in the fire.

An additional HK$50 million will be earmarked by the foundation for follow-up programmes to provide ongoing support and recovery efforts.

The mother of a six-month-old baby tells a Tai Po community group on Facebook that she has not been able to contact her mother-in-law, who was taking care of the child in Wang Cheong House, since 3pm yesterday.

Winnie Hui says the last update was at around 11.30am on Wednesday and that her daughter and in-laws are still missing.

“It has been nearly 24 hours... my baby girl needs to drink milk, otherwise she would die…can anyone tell me whether she has been rescued or not?”

Non-profit organisation offering help
Angus Ng Hok-ming, chairman of Greater Bay Youth, a non-profit organisation registered in Hong Kong, is at Tung Cheong Street Community Hall with about 100 volunteers.

“We have 700 people in our organisation and started mobilising people from midnight,” he said. “We have about 100 here, and another 100 at Tai Po Community Centre.

“We are all volunteers and not aiming to add any trouble to the Home Affairs Department or Social Welfare Department staff working here, but it’s obvious they do not have enough manpower, probably don’t even have one-tenth of what we have here.”

Ng, 41, adds that his volunteering teams have collected enough daily essentials on their own and will distribute them to those in need.

“We have people monitoring social media so we know what is needed, and where,” he said. “We have enthusiasts donating daily essentials to us.

“We will also go talk to those fire hazard residents on our own and jot down what they need, and whatever we can to help.”

Housing estate’s renovation plans
According to the main contractor’s presentation handout, Prestige Construction and Engineering Co. Ltd was appointed in 2016 to renovate the residential estate.

Built in 1983, Wang Fuk Court was sold under the government’s Home Ownership Scheme and is composed of eight blocks, each with 31 floors and a total of 1,984 flats.

The renovation was greenlit after housing authorities flagged the residential estate for a mandatory building and window inspection in 2016 due to its old age.

The roughly HK$300 million (US$38.6 million) renovation project was met with some objections from residents at that time, who complained it was too expensive.

It took eight years of planning before the renovation works started in January 2024.

The entire renovation was originally scheduled to be finished by the second quarter of 2026. The project was divided into three stages, which involved a wide range of upgrades from its facade to structural repairs and waterproofing work.

Lucky dog owner
A retiree surnamed Tsang was walking his dog near Wang Shing House at around 3pm yesterday when he noticed a fire breaking out in another building.

“I saw a lot of smoke and flames. When I tried to go back upstairs, the firefighters had already blocked the way and were telling everyone to leave,” says Tsang, who is in his 70s.

He says he feels fortunate that his wife and daughter were not at home at the time – and that he had taken his dog with him.

“At least our whole family is safe,” he says, adding that they plan to stay at a friend’s place while looking for long-term accommodation.

Third of residents elderly
Most residents in the eight blocks in Wang Fuk Court are middle-aged and elderly people, according to the 2021 population census statistics from the government.

In Wang Yan, Wang Tao and Wang Sun houses, there are around 1,600 residents, and more than 36 per cent of them are people aged 65 or older.

This age group takes up 31.5 per cent among the some 1,200 residents in Wang Kin and Wang Tai Houses, and 40.6 per cent in around 1,800 people living in Wang Cheong, Wang Shing and Wang Chi Houses.

Those aged 40 to 64 took up a quarter to more than 32 per cent of residents among those buildings.

‘This is déjà vu’, Shanghai residents say
The Tai Po fire has reminded many internet users from Shanghai of a blaze in a high-rise building that killed 58 people in the central coast metropolis in November 2010.

On that occasion, sparks from welding torches during exterior renovations ignited nylon netting and scaffolding. Many of the victims, including 71 injured, were retired teachers living in the building.

“This is déjà vu! Shanghainese, especially those from Jingan district, can’t bear to see this. This is too tragic. It instantly brings back our painful memories,” one social media user named Ami says.

Many others concurred, with a number of social media commenters moved to share their experiences from the 2010 fire.

“I was rehearsing a song at the Workers’ Stadium on Jiaozhou Road and Changping Road when I heard a crackling sound outside,” one commenter named Anson says in a post.

“Looking in the direction of the sound, I saw thick smoke rising, and the bamboo scaffolding surrounding the building was burning and exploding... It was also lunchtime, and many people hadn’t realised what was happening yet.”

More than 20 officials and businessmen were jailed for up to 16 years in the wake of the Shanghai building fire. Charges included abuse of authority and corruption after investigators found illegal subcontracting, fake bid offering and poor organisation of the renovation project.

Victim says workers may have been smoking
A resident of Wang Yan House, surnamed Ho, says some construction workers “surely were smoking at work”, before the fire took hold.

Ho, who worked at a printing company before retiring a few years ago, says his wife and seven-year-old grandchild escaped the fire safely.

“I received messages alerting us about the fire. I went downstairs to check myself and saw what happened,” he says. “My son-in-law then asked us to evacuate so I went upstairs to pick up my wife and my grandchild. I didn’t dare to use the lift so we took the stairs.”

A resident on the 21st floor, Ho says he smelled smoke on Wednesday morning.

“I just opened the window and in an instant, there was some smoky smell coming through,” the 76-year-old says. “Those construction workers were working near my flat, probably the 18th or 20th floor, so they were surely smoking.”

Disbelief, flood of condolences on mainland social media
The fire has become the most discussed topic on mainland China’s social media platforms, including Weibo and WeChat, since Wednesday night, with users in expressing disbelief, shock, condolences and sympathies.

“I thought Hong Kong was always a very well-managed city and they have very extensive experience in coping with fires at high rise buildings. The footage of the Taipo fire is indeed shocking and I can’t believe this can happen in Hong Kong!” a Weibo user from Beijing posts on Thursday morning.

“I hope those who are missing will be found safe and sound. It is heartbreaking to watch it live as so many people lose their homes and loved ones all of a sudden,” another user from Guangdong says.

“Bamboo scaffolding is no longer used on the mainland, but it is still so popular in Hong Kong. Saw a video yesterday of it crackling and popping as it burned. I think after the fire, Hong Kong should really get rid of them and use steel ones.”

World’s worst fires
The 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in London that killed 72 is the worst residential fire in the United Kingdom during peacetime, remaining a global reference point for fire safety failures.

The deadliest single-building fire in recorded history occurred at the Dayananda Anglo Vedic School in Mandi Dabwali, India, in 1995, where 540 people, mostly children, died.

In 2000, the Shanxi coal mine dormitory fire in China claimed 374 lives of miners and workers. Investigators found that the fire started from an electrical fault.

Hong Kong’s deadliest fire
The death toll in Tai Po, which at the last count was 44, has become the deadliest building blaze in Hong Kong, surpassing the Garley Building fire in 1996 that claimed 41 lives and left 81 injured.

Welding was eventually found to be the source of that fire, with the 16-storey commercial building in Jordan undergoing internal renovation at the time.

The blaze exposed the absence of sprinkler systems in pre-1987 buildings and led to stricter laws requiring upgraded fire protection in old buildings.

Relatives search for family
An inter-departmental help desk has been set up in the lobby of the Prince of Wales Hospital’s main block for the relatives of the injured and deceased.

A 76-year-old retired construction worker, who only gives his surname Lam, tells the Post he lost his 80-year-old brother in the fire. He came to the hospital first thing in the morning to look for his sister-in-law and nephew, but the pair are still unaccounted for.

“They didn’t pick up the phone since yesterday. I’m so worried that they are still in the house,” he says. “We don’t know whether we should do [the funeral] for one or for three.”

Holding a tissue in his hand, he says he wants to know where his brother’s body was found – whether he was in the house or in the hallway trying to escape.

Latest from Tung Cheong Street Community Hall
At just past 10am, a Post reporter on site at the Tung Cheong Street Community Hall witnesses citizens flocking to the ground floor to leave behind daily essentials as helpers are busy sorting out and arranging how the items will be used.

An official on site says multiple government departments including Home Affairs, Social Welfare and the Hong Kong Police are on site to help those affected.

“We have spaces on the first and third floors, so we’re accommodating a few hundred people here,” the official said.

“As of now, we do have enough water, food, and clothes etc and I believe the affected residents are settling down as well. They are free to go anywhere they want, like have a breakfast nearby and come back for rest.”

A sleepless night
A retiree surnamed Ho, in his sixties, who has lived in Wang Yan House for three decades, spent last night at the Church of Christ in China Fung Leung Kit Memorial Secondary School and did not sleep at all.

“My two family members went to stay with a friend, but I want to remain nearby to keep an eye on my flat,” Ho says.

He recalls hearing the fire alarm yesterday afternoon and initially assuming it was a false alert. After checking on a few neighbours, he went downstairs to see what was happening and saw flames from Block F already reaching the top of the scaffolding covering the building.

“I thought my block, Block A, would be safe — maybe the fire would only spread to two buildings. But it suddenly spread so fast. When I tried to go back upstairs, I couldn’t do it anymore.”

No Filipinos killed or injured, despite overseas reports
The Philippines is in contact with Hong Kong authorities following reports of Filipinos trapped in burning residential estates in Tai Po district, according to the Philippine News Agency.

“The Department of Foreign Affairs said Thursday there are no confirmed reports of Filipinos killed or injured as a result of the Level 5 fire that engulfed seven out of the eight high-rise buildings in the neighbourhood,” the agency said in a social media post.

Occupants at risk as buildings structurally compromised by heat
Polytechnic University adjunct professor and electric engineer Ho Wing-ip warns that structural integrity of the buildings could be compromised because the strength of the reinforcement bars inside concrete walls could be greatly weakened when they are burned at 550 to 600 degrees Celsius for hours.

“There are high risks for people trapped inside the buildings and for the firemen,” he says.

For buildings that have burned the longest - including Wang Cheong House, the first that caught on fire - he believes it is more financially viable to tear them down for redevelopment than to restore them.

Windows sealed with styrofoam
Some windows of the flats are suspected to be sealed with styrofoam, a material which might have exacerbated the spread of the fire.

The government has said renovations at Wang Fuk Court were being carried out by Prestige Construction & Engineering Co Limited. According to its handouts about the project, polystyrene foam is used to cover windows on the facade of the buildings.

Wang Fuk Court resident had concerns about scaffolding nets
Mr Tang, a resident at Wang Fuk Court, says he had previously seen people - residents and construction workers - dropping cigarette butts everywhere after smoking in the building.

He adds that scaffolding nets around the buildings had been blown away during the typhoons in recent months and had been replaced afterwards. Tang says there had been safety concerns over the new nets among him and some other residents.

Regarding the government’s help, Tang says he hopes the arrangement of allowing affected residents to move into temporary housing estates will be adequate. He is worried that it will be difficult to send his children to school if the allocations are not near to Tai Po.

Domestic helper worried about missing friends
Josefina Molina, a 52‑year‑old Filipino domestic helper living in Kwong Yau House, one of the closest blocks facing the burning Wang Fuk Court, recalls what she saw yesterday.

“I noticed the fire around 3pm while I was hanging clothes, and many people started gathering, including police and firefighters. I was told to leave the building and spend the night outside because the smoke could affect us,” she says.

“I quickly called my friend who lives in Wang Fuk Court and told her to warn her employers not to return home and to find a hotel as soon as possible. I haven’t had time to check on them since last night, but I hope they’re safe.”

Molina is “very worried” after seeing online SOS messages about missing domestic helpers and elderly residents, and says she can only pray they are found. She adds that food and water were sufficient overnight. She is now awaiting further instructions on when she and others can return home.

Safety adviser calls for styrofoam ban on construction sites
Lee Kwong-sing, a safety adviser and president of the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioners, says that conducting external maintenance work simultaneously on all eight buildings did not increase the fire risk.

But he notes that the use of styrofoam to seal windows did aid the quick spread of the fire, and calls for a blanket ban on styrofoam use on all construction sites, even if it is just for temporary use. He also urges relevant authorities to conduct more checks on sites.

Crowds gather at nearby Kwong Fuk Estate
The footbridge linking Tai Po Market MTR station to Kwong Fuk Estate — one of the closest points where the public can see the fire — is packed with residents and reporters.

Kwong Fuk Estate has at least three shelters open. Staff at the Hong Kong Children & Youth Service Centre say around 20 affected residents are resting there, while the community hall is hosting more people.

In an outdoor area, a couple from a mid‑level unit in Wang Cheong House sit wrapped in quilts. They say they came straight from work after hearing the news yesterday afternoon.

“It looks horrifying from the live videos, and we can’t imagine what our home is like now,” says the wife, who declines to give her name.

Fire resistant scaffolding mesh not required by law
Ho Ping-tak, chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union (Tung-king) says fire resistant scaffolding nets are not required by law.

Speaking on a radio programme on Thursday, he says the Code of Practice for Bamboo Scaffolding Safety only suggests that such nets be used on construction sites.

“Even if the Labour Department conducts checks on the nets, they will only review if certain certificates have been obtained by the contractors,” he adds.
