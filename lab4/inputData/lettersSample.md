### Define the rules for using the emergency alert system

This November marks the fifth anniversary of Hong Kong’s HK$150 million (US$19.3 million) emergency alert system. In five years, it has been activated [only once](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3170001/startled-screeching-sound-your-mobile-phone?module=inline&pgtype=article). This raises serious questions about the gap between policy intent and operational reality.

In a [response](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202310/18/P2023101800416.htm?fontSize=1) last month to a legislator’s inquiry on whether the government has a mechanism to disseminate natural disaster alerts through the system, the Security Bureau said bureaus and departments may seek approval to use the system in justified emergency situations. This suggests there is a clear pathway to activating the system.

However, our inquiries to three frontline departments – the Hong Kong Observatory, the Fire Services Department and the Hong Kong Police Force – reveal a different picture. All three emphasised their preference for existing communication channels, including social media, mobile apps and press releases.

While the government says departments can use the system, there appears no operational mechanism for them to do so. Without established protocols and departmental ownership, this expensive system is likely to remain dormant – even when emergencies strike.
